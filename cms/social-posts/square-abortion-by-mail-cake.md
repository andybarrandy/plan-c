Did you know? The “abortion pill” or medication abortion, is a combination of pills, Mifepristone and Misoprostol, taken 1-2 days apart to end an early pregnancy. ‍

This method has been around for 20 years, and it’s been held from us by politics. But now with telehealth and shipping, it can be an option for people all over the US, no matter their zip code.

⭐️ Visit the Plan C website at Plancpills.org for a Guide to Pills, FAQs and links to hotlines where you can get all your medical and legal questions answered.

⭐️ Share this info and help spread the word. With Roe under threat and states unjustly restricting access, everyone needs know about the option of a self-managed abortion.
