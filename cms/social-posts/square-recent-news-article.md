Recently, @ms\_magazine started a new series called Online Abortion Provider, where they spotlight a wide range of abortion providers across the United States.

In this article, @choixhealth said, "Weâ€™re a completely asynchronous telehealth platform: All of our care is done via medical questionnaires and over text. One benefit is weâ€™re able to see more people in a given dayâ€”which means that weâ€™re increasing access because people donâ€™t have to wait very long to hear from us."

Choix serves folks in California, Colorado, and Illinois.
