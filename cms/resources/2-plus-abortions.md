2 Plus abortions is a campaign for people who have had two or more abortions to share their stories.

[**2 Plus Abortions is building a multi-media collection of true stories of abortions**](https://www.2plusabortions.com/our-stories)**.** Some stories come from people who have written in, others they find in the public sphere. Together they convey the complexity of our reproductive lives, exposing the lie of the stereotypes that assume the worst of girls and women, and also underscore the need for access to safe, shame-free abortions everywhere.
