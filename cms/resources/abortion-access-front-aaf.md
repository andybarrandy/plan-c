Abortion Access Front is a coven of hilarious badass feminists who use humor & pop culture to expose the haters fighting against reproductive rights. Founded by Lizz Winstead (co-creator of The Daily Show), AAFâ€™s vigilant, coffee-fueled abortion defenders create original rapid response media to fire back at the the daily assaults on abortion access AND share tools for everyone to join in the fight! AAF also raises awareness about & directly supports independent abortion providers, which bear the brunt of anti-abortion restrictions and harassment. We are Abortion AF!
