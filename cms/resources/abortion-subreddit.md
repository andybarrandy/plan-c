The Abortion subreddit is great place to learn from peers about their experiences obtaining and using abortion pills for self-manage abortion. The site is moderated by volunteers from the Online Abortion Resource Squad, so you can trust the quality of the information provided.

It is a safe space to ask questions and learn from others. The moderators can respond in both English and Spanish.
