[_Understanding abortion: a visual resource_](https://www.ippf.org/resource/understanding-abortion-visual-resource) aims to fill a gap in communication, reducing literacy and language barriers around abortion messaging. It can be used with a range of different audiences, including people with learning disabilities, to support them in the process of making an informed and consensual decision on pregnancy and abortion.

This resource offers an insight into what the process of having an abortion is like, showing what a young personâ€™s journey would be if they decided to have an abortion.

It is aimed to support community health workers, young people, and others people advocating for an increase in knowledge and information on abortion and reducing the stigma surrounding it. This is a versatile tool, in which the reader can select the most relevant parts of the story according to their needs or those of their audience.

We hope this tool can support those who require more information and may need to access safe abortion services. Resources available in English, French, Spanish, Hindi, and Nepalese.
