This social media toolkit is designed to advocate for medication abortion access in the U.S. based on Dr. Abigail Aikenâ€™s newest research on the safety and effectiveness of no-test telemedicine abortion in the UK. This study is titled, _Effectiveness, safety and acceptability of no-test medical abortion provided via telemedicine: a national cohort study_.

Additionally, this toolkit elevates research on the demand for self-managed abortion in European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, published last month. This study is titled_, Demand for self-managed online telemedicine abortion in eight European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: a regression discontinuity analysis._ The toolkit has key findings from the research, graphics, and sample social copy - use **#SafeButStillObstructed** hashtag if you share.
