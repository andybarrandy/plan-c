Manodiversa shares with us a series of videos subtitled in English, which talk about the need to work on the issue of abortion in diverse people with pregnant bodies (bisexual women, lesbians, trans men and non-binary people). It is part of their project: Diverse women also abort, supported by Safe Abortion Action Fund (SAAF).
