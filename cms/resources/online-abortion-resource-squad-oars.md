Online Abortion Resource Squad (OARS) is a group of volunteers who organize to ensure every post on [**Reddit.com subreddits**](https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/) asking for abortion-related help gets a quality, accurate, compassionate answer.

People often go to the internet when they’re too nervous to call a hotline, don’t have time to sit on the phone, or otherwise have trouble locating resources. Their peer-based online counseling model helps ensure that in the enormous ocean of the internet, people can find the qualified practical, medical, or legal resources that best meet their needs.

They accept volunteers and also donations.
