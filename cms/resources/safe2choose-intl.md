INTERNATIONAL: During COVID-19, [safe2choose](https://www.safe2choose.org/) is continuing to work to ensure that women, especially vulnerable women and young women, are able to access crucial services including safe abortions. An average of 1,000 women from around the world connect monthly to their online abortion counselors, many requesting support with self-managed abortions. Half of the requests require a referral to a  health care provider close to their home - for additional counseling, pills, or services.
