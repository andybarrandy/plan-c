The National Women’s Health Network (NWHN) was founded in Washington, DC, in 1975 to change the conversation about women’s health. They are consumer activists, supported by a national membership of thousands of individuals. They shape policy and support consumer health decisions; monitor the actions of Federal regulatory and funding agencies, the health care industry, and the health professions; identify and expose health care abuses; and mobilize grassroots action for women’s health.
