SASS – Self-managed Abortion; Safe and Supported is a project of [WOMEN HELP WOMEN](https://womenhelp.org/en/page/346/women-help-women-is-about-access-information-and-activism), supporting the rights of people around the world to have information about and access to safe abortion with pills. Inquiries about using abortion pills can be made through a secure [portal](https://abortionpillinfo.org/) and are answered by the skilled counselors of Women Help Women.

The primary goal of SASS is to provide information and support to women in the USA around self managed abortion, to reduce any negative health impact associated with unsafe abortion methods, and to ensure that self-managed abortions are medically and legally as safe as possible.

SASS provides training for those who wish to learn more about abortion pills and support those in their community who are choosing to self-manage their abortions. SASS also supports [Euki](https://abortionpillinfo.org/en/page/378/euki-app), a secure and private app available inEnglish and Spanish that includes information about a range of reproductive health topics, including abortion pills.
