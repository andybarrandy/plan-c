If you are having a hard time after an abortion experience, there is help for you. This workbook can guide you through some basic steps to feeling better emotionally and spiritually. It can also give you suggestions about further help. It may also be useful if you just want more resolution about an abortion experience.

I think this is a really nice self-help book for those looking for a more personal and reflective process through their abortion experience or people who don't know where to begin processing their experience but are a little hesitant to reach out to a hotline at first. It's also completely free.
