On Friday, Americans learned we no longer have a constitutional right to an abortion. In a 6-3 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Mississippi’s ban on abortion after 15 weeks and overruled _Roe. v. Wade_ and _Planned Parenthood v. Casey,_ two landmark cases that for nearly 50 years ensured the right to end a pregnancy safely.

The May leak of Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion promising to erase Roe put abortion rights organizers on high alert, but they’d been preparing for this day long before the specifics were made public. Conservative lawmakers and activists had in recent years used state legislatures to chip away at access to the procedure, inching up the weeks of gestation after which abortion was banned and requiring that providers jump through medically unnecessary hoops to stay in business. While federal courts sometimes stood in the way of these anti-abortion laws taking effect, residents of many states—particularly in the South and Midwest—already had to travel hundreds of miles to get the healthcare they needed. On Friday, the highest court in the land put decision-making fully in the hands of state legislatures and our consistently deadlocked Congress. Reproductive justice organizer Monica Simpson was certain how her work will advance.
