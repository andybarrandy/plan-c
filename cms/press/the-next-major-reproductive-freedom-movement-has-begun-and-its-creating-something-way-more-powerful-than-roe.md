An interesting mood is rippling through abortion advocacy circles right now: a sense of possibility. At first, you might not expect that. The [Supreme Court’s overturn of _Roe v. Wade_](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a40274187/supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade/) is a historic affront, with devastating implications for the health, safety, and autonomy of millions. And so you might expect that people working on the front lines—[abortion providers](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a37787777/abortion-doctor-texas-sb-8/) and reproductive rights activists and community organizers and [clinic defenders](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a26357018/abortion-clinic-escort/)—would curl into a collective ball: _We lost!_ You would be very wrong.
