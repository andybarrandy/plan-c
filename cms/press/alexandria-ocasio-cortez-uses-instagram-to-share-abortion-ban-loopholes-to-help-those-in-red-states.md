Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has responded to the [overturning of Roe vs Wade](https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/america-abortion-rights) by pledging her support to anyone in need within the United states that have already banned abortion.

Having originally shared a number of slides on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aoc/?hl=en) Story, she added them to her main page for permanence, as well as responding to a Twitter user who had called her out for "posting about how people can skirt abortion bans."

"Yeah, and?" she replied, sharing a screenshot of the exchange and a slideshow entitled: 'How people self-manage abortion using pills'.

Her caption included a quote from Martin Luther King. "Live in a red state? I (and many New Yorkers) are here to help you get the care you need. Info is in Highlights on my profile. 'One has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.' - MLK," she wrote.

The slideshow, created by human rights organisation WeTestify, talks through obtaining 'Plan C' pills for [pregnancy termination](https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/abortion-uk-teenager-real-life-story) and how to use them safely, as well as addressing concerns about surveillance and fears of prosecution.

Adding her own comments, AOC wrote: "Mifepristone + misoprostol (otherwise known as 'Plan C') is a safe, effective way to end pregnancy under 11 weeks. Make sure you get them from a reputable provider, which you can find at places like PlanCPills.org."
