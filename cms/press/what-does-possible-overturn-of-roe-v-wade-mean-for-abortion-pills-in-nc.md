Many women are starting to look for alternatives to abortion drugs as more states mull abortion restrictions ahead of a possible move by the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a landmark abortion decision.

Fifty-nine percent of North Carolina abortions in 2020 were so-called medication abortions, which use a combination of the medications Mifepristone and Misoprostol. The procedure is legal at clinics across the country, including in North Carolina. But alternative sources, such as mail-order abortion drugs, are not legal in this state.

The Federal Drug Administration has approved the procedure

Concerns about the future ability to undergo medical abortions are on the rise following the Monday [leak of a draft opinion](https://www.wral.com/leaked-supreme-court-draft-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/20262467/) indicating that the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. If the opinion becomes final, it would end the federal right to an abortion, leaving restriction decisions up to the states.

“People are really looking for information, preparing for what we anticipate will be really horrible access and looking for alternate sources of supply of the pills,” said Elisa Wells, co-founder of Plan C, a nonprofit that advocates for over-the-counter access to abortion pills. “And we know that's already something people are looking for right now in a lot of the states that don't allow telemedicine abortion, so we already have restrictions on access to care, both through clinics and especially through telemedicine.”
