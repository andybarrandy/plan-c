She held a microphone in her left hand and a sign in her right. "I am the post-Roe generation," it said, a signature of her group Students for Life of America - one of the largest anti-abortion organisations in the country.

Ms Hawkins read the court's decision in real time, shouting the words into her microphone: "The Constitution does not confer the right to abortion."

It was a generational victory for the anti-abortion movement - but for Ms Hawkins it was just a start.

"Our organisation was established as a post-Roe organisation," she told the BBC, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision overturned in June, which had guaranteed women's right to abortion nationwide.

The court's reversal has returned the decision over abortion to individual US states, paving the way for Ms Hawkins' ultimate goal.

"We want to see the states across America move to make abortion unavailable and unthinkable," she said.

Ms Hawkins and her allies already have a new target in their sights: abortion pills.
