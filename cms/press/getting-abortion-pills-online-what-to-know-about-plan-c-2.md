Abortion has long been a contentious issue in America. Since the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion groups have fought hard to see the verdict overturned, while pro-choice advocates have fought just as hard to protect it.

In the past year, several states have seemed to be making headway in the battle against abortion rights, in particular the state of Texas, which passed a so-called [“heartbeat” abortion ban](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/86R/billtext/pdf/HB01500I.pdf), which prohibits abortion once cardiac activity has been detected, usually around 6 weeks into the pregnancy.

The ban is controversial because people often do not even know they are pregnant until well after 6 weeks into their pregnancy.

Most recently, a [leaked draft](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000180-874f-dd36-a38c-c74f98520000) of a U.S. Supreme Court majority opinion has sparked concern that it might be preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade, a move which would leave individual states responsible for deciding whether abortion would be allowed within their borders.
