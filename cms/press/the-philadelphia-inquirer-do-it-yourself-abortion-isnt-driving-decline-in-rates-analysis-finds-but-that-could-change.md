Abortion rights supporters say the method has proved to be very safe, even when doctors are not directly involved. For years, [Women on Web](https://www.womenonweb.org/), founded by Dutch physician Rebecca Gomperts, has shipped prescription abortion pills to women in countries where terminating a pregnancy is illegal. Last year, Gomperts [launched Aid Access](https://www.inquirer.com/health/abortion-pill-online-aidaccess-womenonweb-state-bans-20190526.html) to provide the same service to U.S. women.

Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, listed other web-based initiatives that support self-managed abortion: [PlanCpills.org](https://plancpills.org/), [Women Help Women](https://abortionpillinfo.org/en/), [ProgressFlorida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=TQZ1wZKXpWI).
