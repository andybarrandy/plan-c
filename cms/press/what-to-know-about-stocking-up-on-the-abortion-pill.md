  Advanced provision of abortion pills allows folks to use the pills as soon as
  they realize they are pregnant. As Elisa Wells explains, "why wouldn’t you
  want to have some pills in your medicine cabinet that you could take as soon
  as you have a late period?”

Earlier today, the Supreme Court officially [overturned](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/06/the-supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade-in-abortion-case.html)[_Roe_ v. _Wade_](https://www.thecut.com/2022/06/supreme-court-abortion-ruling-health-care-crisis.html), paving the way for states across America to severely restrict — or even outright ban — [abortion access](https://www.thecut.com/abortion-clinic-near-you). Although the news was largely expected, it still sent shock waves through the nation, sending people scrambling to figure out how they’re going to get an abortion — even if they’re not currently pregnant. In early May, when Politico revealed that the Supreme Court was preparing to overturn _Roe_ v. _Wade_, providers saw a spike in requests for [the abortion pill](https://www.thecut.com/article/find-abortion-pill-what-to-expect.html), and “when asked the reason for the abortion, they were saying, ‘Well, the SCOTUS leak,’” says Elisa Wells, co-founder and co-director of [Plan C](https://www.plancpills.org/), an online database of abortion-pill providers. “I think they’re going to see a surge again starting today.”

Although most providers only dispense abortion pills to pregnant people, some, like [Aid Access](https://aidaccess.org/) and [Forward Midwifery](https://provider.kareo.com/forward-midwifery), offer a service called advance provision, where pills are prescribed in case they are ever needed. Although the practice isn’t widely available at present, Wells suspects that more providers will start making it an option now that _Roe_ has been overturned. Which may leave you wondering: Should you be stocking abortion pills in your own medicine cabinet? And if you do, what are the [risks](https://www.thecut.com/article/abortion-legal-risks-digital-privacy.html)?
