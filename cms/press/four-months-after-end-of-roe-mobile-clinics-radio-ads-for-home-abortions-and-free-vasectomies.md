  Plan C since 2016 has provided information about medication abortion, or
  abortion pills, which were approved by the FDA over 20 years ago to end an
  early pregnancy. Plan C partnered with local groups in Missouri, Oklahoma,
  Arkansas and Mississippi to launch ads on iHeart-owned radio stations in those
  states. The most recent ads launched on Oct. 17 and will run for the next 10
  weeks.

From a mobile abortion clinic traveling along the Illinois border to more men seeking sterilizations, doctors, advocates and patients are responding in new ways to the post-Roe landscape that has left millions of women [**unable to get an elective abortion in their home states**](https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/).

In the past month, radio ad campaigns have been launched in states where abortion is banned to inform listeners how to get medication abortion pills in the mail. And an abortion clinic relocated from Memphis, Tennessee, where abortion is banned, to Carbondale, becoming the nearest abortion clinic for many people across the South.
