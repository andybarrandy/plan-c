If the Supreme Court adopts that opinion, experts forecast that since several states are expected to restrict abortion access, people seeking the procedure will turn to telemedicine and abortion pills because the drugs can be delivered discreetly and can be a way to avoid state bans. And after the [FDA decision in December](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/16/fda-abortion-pill-loosen-rules-525164) to lift requirements that doctors physically distribute the pills, the experts said the online surge only underscores telehealth’s potential role in the looming fight over abortion rights.

Although interest in virtual care has risen, [state licensure](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/article/2022/04/millions-set-to-lose-telehealth-access-across-state-lines-as-waivers-wind-down-00026361) and [nearly 20 states’ bans](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions) on virtual abortion care have led to a patchwork system of regulations that make receiving care across state lines difficult, if not illegal.
