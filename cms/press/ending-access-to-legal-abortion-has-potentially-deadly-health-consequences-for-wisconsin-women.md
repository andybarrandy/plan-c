If the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade later this year, abortion would become criminalized in our state. An 1849 Wisconsin law would immediately become enforceable; this law deems both performing and obtaining abortions as felonies. Our research documents that physicians in our state overwhelmingly predict that Roe’s potential fall could have serious consequences for Wisconsinites’ health and wellbeing.

In our professional roles at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, we conducted two different abortion-related studies of Wisconsin doctors. In one, we surveyed more than 900 physicians practicing at UW’s School of Medicine and Public Health. Across all medical specialties, doctors overwhelmingly opposed legal restrictions on abortion healthcare services. For example, 91% said that women’s healthcare in Wisconsin would get worse if Roe v. Wade were overturned and the state’s abortion law took effect. More than 90% also expressed concern that restrictive abortion laws will make it difficult for patients to receive the care they need.

We also interviewed doctors who directly provide, or recently had provided, abortion healthcare in Wisconsin. Given their hands-on experience with reproductive healthcare delivery, these physicians offer a first-hand glimpse into the potential consequences of the criminalization of abortion in our state. Their concerns fall into three broad areas.
