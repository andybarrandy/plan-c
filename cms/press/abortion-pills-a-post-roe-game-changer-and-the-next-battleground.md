The future of abortion in the U.S. is moving to the mailbox.

Medication abortion, in which a woman takes two drugs to terminate an early pregnancy at home, became the [most commonly used method](https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-02-24/over-half-of-u-s-abortions-now-done-with-pills-not-surgery) in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly after the Food and Drug Administration stopped requiring the prescription be [dispensed](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-12-16/us-regulators-lift-in-person-restrictions-on-abortion-pill) at healthcare facilities and allowed it to be delivered directly to users. Many online pharmacies around the world ship them without a prescription at all.

As the Supreme Court [prepares to give states the power](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-02/supreme-court-set-to-strike-down-abortion-rights-politico-says) to ban abortion, medication abortion could be a game changer — the last option for [women](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-04/what-will-the-supreme-court-ruling-in-roe-mean-for-red-states) in conservative states who are unable to travel elsewhere to end their pregnancies.

“We see medication abortion as being a potentially transformative and disruptive technology in the face of these unjust laws that are being passed,” said Elisa Wells, co-founder and co-director of Plan C, a website that provides information on finding and using the medication. “It is a bit of a safety net, potentially.”
