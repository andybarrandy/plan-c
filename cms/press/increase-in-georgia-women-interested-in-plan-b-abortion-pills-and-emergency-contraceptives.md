”I think people are afraid,” said Lauren Frazier Planned Parenthood.

Local clinics in Georgia with affiliation with Planned Parenthood say their offices have been busier than usual.

”At all of our health centers we have seen a significant increase in people calling in, wanting to get birth control, emergency contraception, we have even had people call about vasectomies and tubal ligation services,” said Frazier.

Lauren Frazier believes some women are afraid the possible overturn of Roe v. Wade could mean the end of access to Plan B, abortion rights even birth control.

”I absolutely don’t think folks are in fear for no reason,” said Frazier.
