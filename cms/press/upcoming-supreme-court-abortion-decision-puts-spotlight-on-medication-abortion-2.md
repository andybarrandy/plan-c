While the Supreme Court considers whether to [scrap its nearly five-decade-old decision](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-mississippi-abortion-case-hearing/) in Roe v. Wade, the war over abortion rights is moving into a new chapter, with both sides of the issue girding for states to shift their focus to medication that induces abortion in early pregnancy.  

The upcoming decision from the high court, coupled with an easing of federal rules governing how abortion pills are dispensed announced in December, has brought new urgency to efforts in Republican-led states to place new limits on medication abortion. And that push took on even more importance after a [draft majority opinion from the Supreme Court](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roe-v-wade-supreme-court-overturn-politico-draft-opinion/) was published by Politico that indicated the court had voted to overturn Roe.

The court confirmed the authenticity of the draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito and circulated in February among the justices, but stressed it did not represent a decision by the court or the final position of its members. Still, disclosure of the document sparked a firestorm of controversy and placed renewed attention on medication abortion, with demand for the pills likely to rise if Roe is reversed.
