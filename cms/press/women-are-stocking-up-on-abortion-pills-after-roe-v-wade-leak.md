In the aftermath of [the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion threatening the status of Roe v. Wade](https://www.newsweek.com/roe-leak-prompts-us-senate-begin-process-protect-abortion-rights-1703254), an uptick of interest in [abortion pills](https://www.newsweek.com/abortion-pills-that-are-legal-us-how-order-online-1702875) was noted by telehealth providers and advocacy groups.

Several providers told _Newsweek_ of substantial increases in activity in the past couple of days. One organization saw a five-fold increase in web traffic, while another reported an increase from five-to-10 requests for help a day to three-to-four an hour.

Some seeking the pills are not even pregnant but hoping to have medication on hand in case the need arises. "Sort of like having Plan B in your cabinet, now we're having Plan C—or abortion pills—in your cabinet," said Christie Pitney, the CEO of Forward Midwifery.
