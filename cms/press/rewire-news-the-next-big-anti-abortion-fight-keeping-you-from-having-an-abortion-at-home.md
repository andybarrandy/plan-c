“I think they’ve been aware of it but maybe didn’t understand the degree to which it’s a transformative technology especially when combined with the internet and with our global commerce system,” said Elisa Wells, the cofounder of Plan C, a website that provides people with information about self-managed abortion with pills. “They’re clearly concerned because they see the promise of the \[abortion pill\] to make abortion accessible to those who need it.”

Focusing more heavily on the FDA’s regulation of medication abortion means anti-abortion activists may have to subtly change their strategy. The movement has long relied on [abortion later in pregnancy](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pangn9/how-debates-over-abortion-later-in-pregnancy-hurt-the-women-who-need-them) to associate graphic and misleading imagery with abortion in general, and put clinics in the crosshairs of [anti-choice legislation](https://rewire.news/legislative-tracker/law-topic/targeted-regulation-of-abortion-providers/), [protest](https://rewire.news/article/2015/04/01/anti-choice-protesters-terrorize-mississippi-community/), and [violence](https://rewire.news/article/2019/05/31/the-escalation-of-anti-abortion-violence-ten-years-after-dr-george-tillers-murder/).
