##### The state is trying to regulate something it can’t: the decentralized distribution of pills largely originating in Mexico, where abortion is no longer a crime.

If you’re seeking anabortion in Texas, [despite the state’s recent ban](https://newrepublic.com/article/163485/heres-happens-texass-extreme-abortion-ban-goes-effect), you still have options. Youcan go to [AidAccess.org](https://aidaccess.org/), where an overseas doctor will prescribe the samemedications that you would get in a clinic and have the pills shipped fromIndia in a few weeks. You can buy the pills from [online pharmacies](https://www.plancpills.org/guide-how-to-get-abortion-pills#find-pills). You can have a remote consultation with a legal abortionprovider in a less restrictive state, like New Mexico, and get the pillsshipped to your Texas address via [mail forwarding](https://www.plancpills.org/guide-how-to-get-abortion-pills#find-pills). Or you can do what countless U.S. residents do to findmore affordable medications of all kinds: cross the border into Mexico.
