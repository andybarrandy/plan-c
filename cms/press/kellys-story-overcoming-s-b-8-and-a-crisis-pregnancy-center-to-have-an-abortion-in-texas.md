  Through ingenuity, persistence and a little luck, some Texans are wading

When Kelly found out she was pregnant, she was eight weeks along. At first, she ended up at a crisis pregnancy center thinking it was a medical clinic. [Crisis pregnancy centers](https://msmagazine.com/tag/cpcs-and-fake-clinics/) (CPCs) are religiously motivated, anti-abortion organizations that masquerade as reproductive health clinics to interfere with access to abortion. The more than [2,500 CPCs](https://crisispregnancycentermap.com/) across the country provide virtually [no medical services](https://alliancestateadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/107/Alliance_CPC_Report_Feb2022_UrgentBrief2-10-22.pdf), but try to divert women away from abortion by spreading fabricated claims about the dangers of abortion. In Texas, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics nine to one.

Despite dire warnings from people at the CPC, Kelly persisted in her search for abortion healthcare. She couldn’t leave the state because she had a new job, but she figured out how to obtain abortion pills using telemedicine from an out-of-state provider and mail forwarding.
