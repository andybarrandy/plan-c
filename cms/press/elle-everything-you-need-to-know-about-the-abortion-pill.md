##### **Is it safe to buy the abortion pill from an online pharmacy?** 

Some people in the U.S. choose to self-manage their abortions by ordering the abortion pill through non FDA-approved websites. Plan C, an organization established to provide women more information about medication abortion, has developed a "[report card](https://plancpills.org/reportcard)" guide showing how authentic these unregulated sites are.
