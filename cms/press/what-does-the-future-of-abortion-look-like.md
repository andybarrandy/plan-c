  While criminalizing abortion will have dire consequences, it doesn’t
  necessarily mean a return to the dangers of 50 years ago. New pharmaceuticals
  have made surgical abortion less necessary, and new resources have sprung up
  to help people obtain and self-administer those drugs. It’s not the same
  experience as what you would get from Planned Parenthood or other medical
  providers, but it’s a far cry from the worst-case-scenario options of pre-Roe
  America. Instead, it’s a new kind of digital underground, with providers,
  volunteers, and pregnant people all taking calculated risks to stay safe in
  the chaotic new system.

The danger for many people isn’t medical — it’s legal.

We can see hints of that system in states where abortion rights have already been heavily restricted. “We’re already in a post-Roe world in places like Texas,” says Elisa Wells, co-founder of [Plan C](https://www.plancpills.org/), an online abortion resource, noting that expansive bans like SB 8 have rendered abortion functionally illegal in much of the South. In places where abortion is all but inaccessible, there are some echoes of an earlier era, like well-off abortion seekers heading to “safe” states like New York and California for their procedures. But Texas as well as places outside the US where abortion is currently criminalized don’t look like 1970s America.
