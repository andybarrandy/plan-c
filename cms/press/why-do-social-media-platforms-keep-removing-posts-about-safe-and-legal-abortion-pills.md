Not all the 39 patients who asked Christie Pitney for abortion pills last week were pregnant. Some had IUDs or were on birth control, and they wanted to have the pills—an [extremely safe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-02-17/abortion-pill-mifepristone-is-safer-than-tylenol-and-almost-impossible-to-get), [FDA-approved](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information) regimen that is now the [most common](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions) way of terminating a pregnancy in the United States—on hand, just in case. “They’re very, very worried and scared about what the future holds,” says Pitney, an [advanced practice midwife](https://provider.kareo.com/forward-midwifery) who prescribes abortion pills virtually to patients.

The patients had found Pitney through [Aid Access](https://aidaccess.org/en/), an organization that connects people who want medication abortions with telehealth providers who can give them online consultations and order the pills for them. Those providers include people like Pitney, who works with patients in states where telehealth abortion is legal, as well as Rebecca Gomperts, an [internationally based doctor](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/05/a-dutch-doctor-has-been-mailing-abortion-pills-to-women-in-the-us-now-the-fda-is-going-after-her/) who serves patients in the states [where it is not](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/03/16/as-abortion-pills-take-off-some-states-move-to-curb-them). In the week after _Politico_ [posted](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473) the draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn _Roe v. Wade_, traffic to the Aid Access website soared to 114,000 visitors; that week, the group’s providers ordered pills for a whopping 1,614 patients—about the same number as it served in the span of two months last year, according to data from Pitney.
