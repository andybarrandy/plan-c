The US Supreme Court decision overturning federal abortion rights sets the stage for conservative states to drastically limit access to a pill used to end early pregnancies.

The ruling is likely to make abortion illegal in [half the country](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/supreme-court-overturns-roe-v-wade-abortion-rights-ruling) and puts the authority to regulate the procedure back in the hands of state governments. Legal scholars say the move could spur states to go after [mifepristone](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/abortion-pill-access-will-remain-post-roe-fda-rules-explained), a medication that’s used for the majority of US abortions.

“Abortion pills are the new battleground. In many states they will be illegal,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of Georgetown University’s O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. “There will be a race to the bottom for who can be the most restrictive state.”

The Biden administration is already shoring up efforts to counter the Supreme Court ruling’s impact on abortion drugs.

Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra has said he’s directing the agency to “do any and everything we can” to ensure “the right to safe and legal abortion” through medication. Attorney General Merrick Garland also joined the fray, asserting that states can’t ban mifepristone based on disagreement with the Food and Drug Administration’s “expert judgment about its safety and efficacy.”

That, however, doesn’t mean that states won’t try to find other means to block access to the drugs.
