Medication abortion, or taking a combination of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, [**is an increasingly common**](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions) method for ending pregnancies in the United States. Reasons vary and overlap: Some women lack access to in-person abortion clinics; others prefer to end pregnancies in the comfort of their own home. Others seek out the pills because they [**cost far less**](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01528) than surgical abortion.

With more [**in-person clinics shuttering**](https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/Trends%20in%20Abortion%20Care%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C%202017-2021.pdf) and a Supreme Court that’s [**threatening to overturn _Roe_ v. _Wade_**](https://www.vox.com/2022/5/3/23055125/roe-v-wade-abortion-rights-supreme-court-dobbs-v-jackson), a small but growing number of reproductive experts have been encouraging discussion of an idea called “advance provision” — or, more colloquially, stocking up on abortion pills in case one needs them later.

It’s an idea that has merit: Mifepristone has a shelf life of about [**five years**](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/major-us-abortion-pill-producer-ample-supply-demand/story?id=84643247), misoprostol [**about two**](https://www.ghsupplychain.org/sites/default/files/2019-02/MNCH%20Commodities-Misoprostol.pdf), and both drugs work better the earlier in a pregnancy you take them. In states that are ramping up abortion restrictions, there’s often a race against the clock to access care. In Texas, for example, if you don’t realize until eight weeks in that you’re pregnant — which could be only a couple of weeks after a missed period — you would have already passed [**the state’s new legal deadline**](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/12/02/texas-ban-medical-abortion/) for obtaining abortion pills. But if you had already stored them in your home, or your friend or neighbor had, then you’d be able to take them.
