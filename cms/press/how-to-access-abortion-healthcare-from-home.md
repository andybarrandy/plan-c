Considering the [current attack on reproductive rights for women](https://wearemitu.com/fierce/how-to-access-abortion-healthcare-in-florida-texas-mississippi-and-oklahoma/), it’s crucial that we be as well-informed as possible. Although the government has forced us to play an anti-oppression Whac-A-Mole — which we seem to be losing at the moment — new, creative options for women continue to pop up too. If we can thank the COVID-19 pandemic for anything, it’s the rise of remote options, not only for work and school, but also for medical consultations and even treatments. The pandemic was also directly responsible for the suspension of the FDA restriction that limited the mailing of abortion pills after telehealth appointments.
