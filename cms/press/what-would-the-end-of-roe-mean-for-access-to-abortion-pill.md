  If Roe v. Wade is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, states may enact bans
  on abortion including both in-person surgical abortion and medication
  abortion, commonly referred to as the abortion pill. Several states have
  already passed restrictions that reduce access to medication abortion such as
  requiring in-person counseling or ultrasounds or bans on telehealth.

A draft Supreme Court ruling that would overturn Roe v. Wade means that abortion pills may become a key part of the next legal frontier to access to abortion.

If finalized, the ruling would overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade court opinion that established a national right to an abortion, as well as a later ruling, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, that affirmed the right. If that happens, then each state could set laws about whether and when to allow abortion. Some states already have [laws](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/may/03/what-would-state-laws-look-post-roe-world/) that would reinstate abortion restrictions if Roe v. Wade is overturned.

We wondered about what such a future ruling could mean for medication abortion, commonly referred to as the abortion pill. About half the states would be expected to enact laws that would ban abortion â€” and that would apply to both surgery and the abortion pill.
