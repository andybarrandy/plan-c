In June 2020, a new medical protocol for medication abortion was introduced: Gynuity led the collaborative development of [a sample protocol for providing medication abortion without any routine facility-based tests](https://gynuity.org/resources/no-test-medication-abortion-a-sample-protocol-for-increasing-access-during-a-pandemic-and-beyond) either before or after treatment.

From Gynuity: We expect that the no-test approach will continue to be beneficial after the epidemic ends, by decreasing cost and enhancing convenience and comfort of medical abortion and by facilitating new service delivery approaches that can increase access to this essential health care.
