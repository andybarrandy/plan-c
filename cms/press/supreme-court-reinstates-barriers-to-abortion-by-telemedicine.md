##### The Court requires in-person visits for patients seeking medication abortion despite the risks of COVID-19.

In January, the U.S. Supreme Court [granted](https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20A34.pdf) a Trump Administration request to reinstate a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule requiring patients seeking a medication abortion to make a medically unnecessary in-person visit to their health care provider to pick up the abortion pill mifepristone.

The Court’s decision in [_FDA v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists_](https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20A34.pdf) reverses a federal district court [ruling](https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/files/advocacy/pi-order-medication-abortion-71320.pdf?la=en&hash=D20597427CA8EBEA568D45EB9672AA80) from last July that suspended the FDA rule during the pandemic. In that lower court decision, Judge Theodore Chuang [ruled](https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/files/advocacy/pi-order-medication-abortion-71320.pdf?la=en&hash=D20597427CA8EBEA568D45EB9672AA80#page=49) that the FDA’s required in-person visit imposed a “substantial obstacle” to abortion health care that is likely unconstitutional. Judge Chuang’s order [allowed](https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/files/advocacy/pi-order-medication-abortion-71320.pdf?la=en&hash=D20597427CA8EBEA568D45EB9672AA80#page=79) clinicians to mail mifepristone to patients after a telemedicine consultation. As a result of the judge’s order, clinicians across the country [began](https://msmagazine.com/2020/11/16/just-the-pill-choix-carafem-honeybee-health-how-telemedicine-startups-are-revolutionizing-abortion-health-care-in-the-u-s/) offering abortion medication by telemedicine, and U.S.-based online pharmacies began to [ship](https://msmagazine.com/2020/09/30/honeybee-health-us-based-online-pharmacy-first-to-ship-abortion-pills-to-patients-inside-the-u-s/) mifepristone to patients. In fact, a recent nationwide study in the United Kingdom has [shown](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.16668) that no-test telemedicine abortion is just as safe and effective as in-person abortion health care.
