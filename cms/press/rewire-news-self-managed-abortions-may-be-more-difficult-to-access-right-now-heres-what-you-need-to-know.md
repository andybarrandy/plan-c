‘‘The biggest disruption to what we are doing \[at Plan C\] … is that with the airports being closed in India, the supply of Aid Access has been cut off,” said [Elisa S. Wells](https://rewire.news/author/elisa-wells/), co-founder and co-director of Plan C, an organization that advocates for self-managed abortion care and medication abortion pill access. Aid Access and other [online providers](https://plancpills.org/reportcard) have been a reliable resource for patients as some states become increasingly hostile to abortion rights. “Aid Access has been a real safety net and now they aren’t able to provide anything,” Wells said.

Medication abortion, commonly referred to as the abortion pill, is [growing in popularity](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/medication-abortion) for earlier abortion care. Even though medication abortion is safe and common (as are procedural abortions), the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information) that the first pill taken to induce an abortion, mifepristone, must be prescribed by a health-care provider with specific qualifications and can only be dispensed in clinics, medical offices, and hospitals—not at pharmacies. This is a huge barrier: According to the Guttmacher Institute, [89 percent of counties in the country](https://data.guttmacher.org/states/table?state=US&topics=58&dataset=data) don’t have an abortion provider.“
