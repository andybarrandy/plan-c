On Dec. 16, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration lifted long-standing, medically unnecessary restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone. As a result, an increasing number of healthcare providers across the country are offering telehealth abortion servicesâ€”screening patients online and mailing abortion pills to them at home. Despite the FDA ruling, 19 states still have laws requiring patients to see clinicians in person to obtain abortion pills, so people in those states and others where the medication is not yet available are finding creative ways to access abortion pills by mail.
