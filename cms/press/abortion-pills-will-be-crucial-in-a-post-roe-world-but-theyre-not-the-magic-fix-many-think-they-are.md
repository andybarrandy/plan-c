Ever since it [became evident](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/05/roe-wade-abortion-rights-overturned-supreme-court-leak/) that _Roe_ is likely to fall in the coming weeks, activists and folks who are generally interested in preserving abortion access have heralded medication abortion as [the](https://jezebel.com/you-can-now-order-abortion-pills-before-youre-pregnant-1847910143) [great](https://shoutyourabortion.com/abortion-pills/) [solution](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-05-05/medication-abortion-safety-net-battleground) to the end of legal abortion. And it’s true—mifepristone and misoprostol have a lot of advantages that will surely come in handy in our post-_Roe_ future, the main one being that it’s a do-it-yourself, at-home abortion method that is safe and effective.

As Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director at URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity), said in a media briefing, “As we look at the impact of abortion bans, particularly disproportionately impacting communities such as Black and Brown folks, young people, as well as low-income communities, and immigrants, and trans young people, it is even more important that we consider the potential of self-managed abortion as an essential tool for accessing reproductive health care and autonomy for these marginalized communities.”

**_For the past couple of years, I’ve been asking activists: What about the people I know who could never access the medication?_**

Though there are other kinds of self-managed abortions, the major abortion care approach for these communities is abortion pills, according to McGuire and [Abortion on Our Own Terms,](https://abortiononourownterms.org/) a campaign she works with that seeks to help educate pregnant people about their options. McGuire and her colleagues understand that education is an important part of their campaign, especially when it comes to the safety of using mifepristone and misoprostol. “The biggest disinformation that we see out there is the idea that the loss of _Roe v. Wade_ will lead to unsafe abortion, and it’s very rooted in this kind of pre-_Roe_ \[history\] that’s really a different experience of abortion, of what that political context has looked like in the past,” she says. “First and foremost, it’s important that we recognize that we have safe and effective abortion medication pills that we can use today to self-manage our own abortions.”

However, despite even the best of intentions, medication abortion is not a magic fix. More specifically, it is not and will not be the solution for everyone. And the sooner we realize that, the sooner we can set about working toward desperately needed solutions.
