With the prospect of a more conservative Supreme Court on the horizon, some progressive women have begun to fear what will happen if _Roe v. Wade_, the case that legalized abortion, is overturned. Some of these prophecies have centered on a popular meme in the pro-choice community: The coat hanger.

During a recent rally, New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon [held up a wire coat hanger](https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/cynthia-nixon-mother-abortion-wire-hanger.html?utm_medium=s1&utm_campaign=thecut&utm_source=tw) as a warning that we should not return to the previous generation’s means of obtaining illicit abortions. And Representative Lois Frankel, a Democrat from Florida, [banged a coat hanger](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/democratic-lawmaker-uses-coat-hanger-illustrate-abortion-rights-stakes-brett-kavanaugh-nomination) on the table at a briefing while discussing the latest Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.

And this isn’t counting the many happy hours in progressive cities that have become peppered with gallows-humor cracks about coat hangers and back alleys.

But medical technology has progressed significantly since _Roe_ was decided in 1973, and we—realistically, fortunately—won’t see a return to women using coat hangers or other implements to self-abort. Instead, it’s more likely that more and more women will turn to shady online pharmacies to buy abortion pills through the mail—a practice that is already occurring with surprising frequency and effectiveness around the world.
