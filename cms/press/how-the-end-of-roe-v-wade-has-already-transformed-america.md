It took almost half a century to overturn Roe v Wade, the US supreme court decision that enshrined abortion as a constitutional right. But in the three days since [the court’s new ruling was published](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court), a settlement which Americans once assumed was permanent has been immediately shattered.

The conservative-majority court’s decision allows individual states to ban abortion for the first time since 1973. (For a summary of what it means, [see this explainer by Jessica Glenza](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/24/scotus-roe-wade-decision-what-happens-next).) Like any supreme court ruling, the document published on Friday was long and complicated – but the consequences which flow from it are sweeping, and have proceeded at a pace which belies the court’s claimed solemnity.

In some states, abortion was banned the moment the court ruled.
