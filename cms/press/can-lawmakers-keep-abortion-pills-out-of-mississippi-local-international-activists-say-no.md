In the days after the leak of a draft opinion showing the U.S. Supreme Court will likely overturn Roe v. Wade, hundreds of Mississippians visited the [website Plan C](https://www.plancpills.org/) to learn about ordering abortion medication online.

From Jackson and Long Beach, Oxford and tiny Centerville, people used the site to find out how to obtain the pills that will likely become the easiest, cheapest way to end a pregnancy in post-Roe Mississippi.

In the last week of April, 175 people in the state went to the site. In the first four days of May, around the time the [leak was published](https://mississippitoday.org/2022/05/02/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-mississippi-abortion-case/) on the evening of May 2, that number rose to 306, according to Elisa Wells, a co-founder of Plan C, which doesnâ€™t ship pills itself but helps people find how to get them.

The next week, traffic stayed elevated, at 275.

Opponents and supporters of abortion rights agree: After Roe, the future of the abortion fight in Mississippi lies in a set of pills that can end a pregnancy under 10 weeks.
