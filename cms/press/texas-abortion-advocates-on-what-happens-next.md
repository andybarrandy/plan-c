  .Texans once again have an unfortunate head start in having their rights
  stripped away. The state already has one of the strictest abortion laws in the
  country, and abortion restrictions in the state will likely only worsen once
  the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade in the coming months.

Advocates and court watchers are not surprised that the U.S. Supreme Court, in a draft ruling that leaked to the press earlier this week, is prepared to overturn the 1973 _Roe_ _v._ _Wade_ decision in full, and free the various states to ban abortion care. The collapse of the _Roe_ framework for reproductive rights has been in the offing for months if not years, and Texans once again have an unfortunate head start.

"The vast majority of people in this country are pro-choice, but they're silent and they let the minority of people against abortion take up the space," said Amy Hagstrom Miller, president of Austin-based Whole Woman's Health, to the _Chronicle_. Data backs her up: [**Gallup**](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx) polling in 2021 found that 4 of 5 Americans think abortion should be legal in some or all circumstances, a number that's barely budged since the mid-1970s. Results from an April [**UT-Austin survey**](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/04/texas-abortion-ut-poll/) found only 15% of Texans support a total ban.

The Supreme Court heard arguments in December in the Mississippi case, _Dobbs_ _v._ _Jackson Women's Health Organization_, which has provided its five anti-choice right-wing justices – three appointed by Donald Trump – an occasion to throw out _Roe_ and its 1992 follow-up, _Casey v. Planned Parenthood_. Several months earlier, Texas had enacted an abortion ban (as Senate Bill 8) that was even more restrictive than the Mississippi statute, and was able to evade legal challenges to it even as _Roe_ remained in effect. This did not result in an uprising of angry Texans; instead, abortion funds in the state have budgeted to fly people even farther away for care, and nonprofits such as Aid Access have been sending more semi-­contra­band abortion pills to Texans than ever before.
