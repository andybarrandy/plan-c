Today, Americans woke up to a national nightmare as [the U.S. Supreme Court officially overturned Roe v. Wade](https://www.advocate.com/law/2022/6/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-dobbs-decision), declaring that abortion is no longer a constitutional right and that bodily autonomy is a myth for women and trans people.

For the millions who have just been left without safe abortion access in states with Trigger Laws like Texas and Idaho, resources like this will be literally lifesaving. If you’re someone who needs help or information, hopefully one of these organizations has what you’re looking for.
