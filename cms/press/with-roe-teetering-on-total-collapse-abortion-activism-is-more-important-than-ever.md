##### Progress does not happen without popular support, direct action, and outrage in the streets.

_Below is an excerpt from_ [Controlling Women: What We Must Do Now to Save Reproductive Freedom](https://www.hachettebooks.com/titles/kathryn-kolbert/controlling-women/9780306925634/)_, by Kathryn Kolbert and Julie F. Kay, who have spent years on the frontlines of the battle to protect reproductive rights._

We started our book standing in protest in front of the Supreme Court. Neither of us is very good at chanting or making signs, and we both feel more comfortable in a courtroom than in a street dance. While we always enjoy being with friends, kids, and colleagues for a good cause on a sunny day, thatâ€™s not the reason we show up.
