  As the demand for abortion pills grows as people in the United States prepare
  for the overturning of Roe, businesses that exist to distribute and provide
  information on these pills will enter into a new phase of product and

More than half of the abortions in the U.S. are induced through the use of medication, according to the [Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions). The procedure is [allowed by the Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/questions-and-answers-mifeprex) in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, and during the pandemic, the agency stopped requiring that patients obtain the medication in person.

Businesses popped up to help patients meet with providers virtually and get the drugs by mail. If the Supreme Court does repeal Roe v. Wade, those businesses will face an entirely new landscape.
