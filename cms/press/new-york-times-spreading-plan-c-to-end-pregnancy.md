_From the article:_

The [F.D.A. warns against](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111323.htm) purchasing the drugs from online vendors, but [women in the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/22/magazine/a-mother-in-jail-for-helping-her-daughter-have-an-abortion.html) are doing it anyway. Increasingly, advocates of access to the drugs say, women are turning to the internet to procure the pills for use in their homes. 

Plan B, a form of emergency contraception made available [over the counter in 2013](https://img.nyed.uscourts.gov/files/opinions/Tummino%20SJ%20memo.pdf). Plan C piggybacks on that popularity, and hints at how the pills can be used: not necessarily after a pregnancy is certain, but as a medicine a woman can take if she misses her period, without being sure of the reason. In other words, just in case.
