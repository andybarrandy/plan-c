A European organization that provides doctor-prescribed abortion pills by mail is under order by the US Food and Drug Administration to stop deliveries.

The federal agency sent a [warning letter to Aid Access](https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/ucm633126.htm) this month requesting that it "immediately cease causing the introduction of these violative drugs into U.S. Commerce."

There are other ways to get abortion pills by mail in the United States, for women who can't get to or afford clinic visits, but Aid Access is the most affordable option at $95. It also offers the possibility of financial help, according to its website. Plus, Aid Access is the only company to offer physician oversight, according to [a report card](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/10/22/plancreportcardnew.pdf) issued by the grassroots group [Plan C](https://plancpills.org/), which aims to educate women about self-managed abortion. Aid Access was the only one of nine suppliers to receive an A.

Aid Access has 15 business days from receipt of the FDA warning letter, which was dated March 8, to respond. The organization is asked to describe what it will do to remedy any violations, explain why it needs more time to make corrections or offer reasoning for why it is not in violationof regulatory safeguards.
