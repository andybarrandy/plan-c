On June 24, the Supreme Court overturned [_Roe v. Wade_](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/roe-v-wade-overturned-supreme-court), changing our national landscape and leaving many to wonder: Where is abortion illegal now? The answer is complicated.

Trigger laws, which anti-abortion lawmakers had prepped for just this moment, went into effect in some states as soon as the court decision came down, while other states have laws that will outlaw [abortion](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-to-get-an-abortion-now-that-roe-v-wade-has-been-overturned) in the coming weeks. Other states may soon ban or heavily restrict abortion, while others still will move to [protect](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/16-states-have-already-guaranteed-the-right-to-abortion-once-roe-v-wade-is-overturned) it. To say the least, the Supreme Court decision that overturned 50 years of precedent has left many confused as to where their state's abortion law stands.
