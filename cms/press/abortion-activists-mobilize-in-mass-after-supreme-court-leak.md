Carrie Baker opens the homepage for [Plan C](https://www.plancpills.org/), a website that helps people across the U.S. get medication to terminate a first trimester pregnancy. The site’s welcome message: “A safe, at-home abortion is here.”

After years of work to keep clinics that offer abortions open and accessible, Baker has shifted focus to these meds that can be taken anywhere. She helps vet information on the site, which directs people concerned about the legal risks of ordering pills to call a helpline. Baker says getting the word out about these [commonly used pills](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/02/medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions) and where to find them is important as more states prepare to ban all forms of abortion.

“It’s what makes me think that post-Roe will not be like pre-Roe,” says Baker, a professor of women and gender studies at Smith College. “Abortion pills are a technology that means people will have much safer and private ways of self-managing abortions post-Roe.”
