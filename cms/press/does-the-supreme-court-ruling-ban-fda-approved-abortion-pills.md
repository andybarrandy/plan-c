The next legal fight over abortion may center on a pill called mifepristone, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ruled to be safe. Shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, Attorney General Merrick Garland said:

"We stand ready to work with other arms of the federal government that seek to use their lawful authorities to protect and preserve access to reproductive care. In particular, the FDA has approved the use of the medication Mifepristone. States may not ban Mifepristone based on disagreement with the FDA’s expert judgment about its safety and efficacy."
