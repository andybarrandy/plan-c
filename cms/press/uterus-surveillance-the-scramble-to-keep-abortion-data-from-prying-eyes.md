Telemedicine abortion groups, fearful of digital surveillance from states curbing access in a potential post-_Roe_ nation, are shoring up privacy defenses and urging people seeking abortions to take steps to protect their data.

If the Supreme Court overturns _Roe v. Wade,_ telehealth would be crucial to people seeking abortion care, particularly those who live in states that would ban the procedure. Many people are expected to drive across state lines for virtual visits from their cars or have abortion pills mailed to a state where they are allowed, experts said — moves that could create legal risks.

“We’ve seen pregnant people being arrested and prosecuted for years using electronic surveillance. … We can only imagine how much worse it will get in the post-_Roe_ world,” said Albert Fox Cahn, head of the nonprofit organization Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “We’re going to see a huge focus on surveillance of telemedicine and online abortion services because for millions of Americans, that’s going to increasingly be their only way to secure safe abortion care.”
