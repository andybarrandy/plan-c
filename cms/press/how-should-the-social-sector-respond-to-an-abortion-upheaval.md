The Supreme Court is poised to overturn _Roe v. Wade_, according to a draft opinion obtained and [published by _Politico_](http://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473). The draft, written by Justice Samuel Alito and later confirmed to be authentic, would make the legal right to abortion a matter of state law, [effectively criminalizing](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/map-23-states-ban-abortion-post-roe-america-rcna27081) the procedure in most cases in many states.

The online response to the news has been dizzying. At _SSIR_, we have been struggling to process the news ourselves, and so we’ve collected below just a few of the stories and resources we’ve found helpful.

In the hours after the draft was published, many [individuals](https://donations4abortion.com/) and [publications](https://www.thecut.com/article/donate-abortion-fund-roe-v-wade-how-to-help.html) shared links to donate to abortion funds. As described by the [National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/about/) (NNAF), “\[Abortion funds work\] to remove financial and logistical barriers to abortion access. Some of them work with clinics to help pay for your abortion. Some of them offer support such as transportation, childcare, translation, doula services, and somewhere to stay if you have to travel to get your abortion.”

Others publicized organizations that provide access to medication abortion care, which now accounts for more than half of abortions in the United States.

*   [Plan C](https://www.plancpills.org/) is an education resource founded in 2016 to provide “research-based information” about “how people in the U.S. are accessing abortion pills and safely managing their own abortions.”
*   [Abortion On Demand](https://abortionondemand.org/) and [Just the Pill](https://www.justthepill.com/) are two examples of telemedicine services that mail abortion medication to patients to take at home.
