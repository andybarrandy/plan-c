A leak of Supreme Court documents revealed that the court has voted to repeal Roe v. Wade, a landmark decision from 1973 that protects the right to have an abortion. The leaked documents were an initial draft of a majority opinion, meaning that the decision isn’t official, but may be soon, Politico reported.

Medication abortion, or the use of abortion pills, could become a critical resource for people seeking to terminate a pregnancy in a post-Roe America. The pill is already widely used – more than half of all abortions in 2020 were done through use of abortion pills, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.

Abortion-rights activists say that, if Roe is overturned, the demand for abortion pills will soar. Rebecca Gomperts, a physician who founded a nonprofit in Austria to provide abortion pills to U.S. patients, told The Washington Post she already saw that happen when Texas passed a controversial “heartbeat bill” that essentially prohibits abortions six weeks into a pregnancy.
