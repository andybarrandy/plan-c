**IN A PERFECT** world, [abortion access](https://www.wired.com/tag/reproductive-rights/) would be easy. The minute you realized you needed an abortion, you’d be able to grab some [abortion pills](https://www.wired.com/story/abortion-pills-how-they-work/) from the drugstore, or make an appointment with your regular gynecologist for a quick and easy vacuum aspiration. But we don’t live in a perfect world. In modern-day America, abortion access can be [impossible at worst and fraught at best](https://www.wired.com/story/roe-overturned-supreme-court-dobbs-abortion-rights-revolutionized-life-for-women/): even in “safe” states like California and New York, [abortion pills are heavily restricted](https://www.wired.com/story/the-post-roe-battleground-for-abortion-pills-will-be-your-mailbox/) and can be pretty pricey. And since few gynecologists offer abortion services out of their private practice, you need to find a specialized clinic—which can be a challenging process, particularly since many anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy centers” are easy to confuse with actual abortion providers.

And chillingly, things are only going to get worse. Across the country, [expansive bans](https://www.wired.com/story/abortion-bans-create-a-public-health-nightmare/) like Texas’ Senate Bill 8 have rendered abortion functionally inaccessible; now, with the [US Supreme Court overturning _Roe v. Wade_](https://www.wired.com/story/roe-overturned-supreme-court-dobbs-abortion-rights-revolutionized-life-for-women/), access is about to disappear in close to half of America. No one is safe from these bans: Even if abortion rights are legally protected in your home state, an influx of patients from other states is likely to tax an already overstressed system, making appointments difficult to get.
