After more than five years working together in reproductive health clinics in the Washington, D.C., area, nurse-midwife Morgan Nuzzo and ob-gyn Dr. Diane Horvath realized they could do it better. They started fantasizing about a clinic of their own, where clinicians of different backgrounds would provide compassionate, high-quality care; employees would be fairly compensated and patients met with respect; and abortion would be treated as [essential medical care](https://time.com/5660018/hyde-amendment-abortion/) that everyone should be able to access.

Partners in Abortion Care, their all-trimester clinic, is set to open this fall in College Park, Md., a location they hope will be convenient not only for themselves as D.C.-area residents, but also for patients in Maryland and beyond. After the leak of a [draft decision](https://time.com/6173019/supreme-court-leak-roe-v-wade-abortion/) suggesting that the Supreme Court could soon overturn _Roe v. Wade_, which would likely result in the ban or significant restriction of abortion in [26 states](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/26-states-are-certain-or-likely-ban-abortion-without-roe-heres-which-ones-and-why), that location became more crucial than ever.
