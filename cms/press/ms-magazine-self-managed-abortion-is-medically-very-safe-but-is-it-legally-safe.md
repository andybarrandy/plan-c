‘‘The Story of [Plan C](https://plancpills.org/), an organization that helps end an early pregnancy.

But while self-managed abortion in early pregnancy is medically very safe, is it _legally_ safe?

“Only a handful of states make it a crime to have a self-induced abortion,” Lynn Paltrow of the [National Advocates for Pregnant Women](http://advocatesforpregnantwomen.org/) told _Ms._ “In most states, it’s not a crime to take actions that end one’s own pregnancy.”

Paltrow continued: “That being said, even in the overwhelming majority of states where it is not a crime to self-induce an abortion, there are all sorts of laws that that could in theory be applied to people who obtain medications outside of approved medical settings.”

[The states](https://www.ifwhenhow.org/resources/roes-unfinished-promise-2019-update/) that have explicit criminal prohibitions of self-managed abortions are Arizona, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Delaware and Nevada. New York repealed their criminal prohibition on self-managed abortion in 2019. 

And while [thirty-eight states](https://rewire.news/article/2019/05/14/anti-choice-law-criminalize-pregnancy/) have feticide laws that equate pregnancy termination with murder, most explicitly _exclude_ pregnant women from criminal penalties. “
