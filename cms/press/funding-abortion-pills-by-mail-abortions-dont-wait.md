When the Supreme Court overturns _Roe v. Wade_ later this month, pregnant women living in the [26 states](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/26-states-are-certain-or-likely-ban-abortion-without-roe-heres-which-ones-and-why) that are certain or likely to ban abortion will flock to states where abortion is still legal. The increase in women of reproductive age whose nearest provider would be in California will go from 46,000 currently to around 1.4 million women post-_Roe_—[a nearly 3,000 percent increase](https://states.guttmacher.org/#california). In Illinois, this number will go from 100,000 to 8.9 million—a nearly [a 9,000 percent increase](https://states.guttmacher.org/#illinois). Clinics in states with legal abortion will be inundated with patients, creating long waits for in-clinic abortion care.

To address this anticipated influx of patients, California-based [Women’s Reproductive Rights Assistance Fund](https://wrrap.org/) (WRRAP) has created a new “abortion pills by mail” program to fund telehealth abortion providers in 20 states that will maintain legal abortion in order to absorb a lot of the demand for this [safe and effective](https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/medication-abortion-safety.pdf) abortion method and free up brick and mortar clinics to focus on providing in-clinic procedures.
