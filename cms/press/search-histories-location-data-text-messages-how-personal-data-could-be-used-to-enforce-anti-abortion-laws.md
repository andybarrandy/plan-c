he Supreme Court’s Friday ruling to [overturn Roe v. Wade](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/roe-wade-abortion-supreme-court-ruling/index.html) is almost certain to spark a [wave of new state legislation](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/world/us-abortion-law-global-comparison-scotus-intl-cmd/index.html) taking aim at abortion rights, and to reinforce existing laws that prohibit and, in some cases, criminalize the procedure. Among the wide-ranging potential implications of the decision are concerns about the potential use of personal data to punish people who look for information about or access to abortion services online.

In some of the [most restrictive states](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/business/amazon-abortion-costs/index.html), digital rights experts warn that people’s search histories, location data, messages and other digital information could be used by law enforcement agencies investigating or prosecuting abortion-related cases.
