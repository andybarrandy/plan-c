As states pass [ever-expanding abortion restrictions](https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/03/2022-state-legislative-sessions-abortion-bans-and-restrictions-medication-abortion) and people search online for how to find abortion services, accurate online information is more critical than ever. But anti-abortion groups are spreading misinformation to interfere with women’s access to abortion information and services.

If you Google “abortion services near me,” chances are an anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy center” advertisement will appear at the top of your search. There are over [2,500 CPCs](https://crisispregnancycentermap.com/) across the country. They [masquerade as women’s health clinics](https://msmagazine.com/2022/04/11/roe-v-wade-overturned-crisis-pregnancy-centers/) to lure in pregnant women and use [medically-inaccurate information and coercive tactics](https://alliancestateadvocates.org/crisis-pregnancy-centers/) to obstruct their access to abortion.

Reproductive rights advocates fighting abortion misinformation are [encountering headwinds](https://msmagazine.com/2021/11/30/facebook-anti-abortion-misinformation-abortion-pill-reversal/) in their efforts to promote accurate, science-based information on social media.

One tactic CPCs use is to buy Google ads making themselves appear to be abortion clinics. After abortion advocacy groups raised the issue, Google [adopted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/19/google-loophole-anti-abortion-clinics-deceptive-ads) a [policy](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9274988?hl=en) in [June of 2019](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/9297839?hl=en) requiring the flagging of abortion advertisements for organizations that do not provide abortion with a warning—“does not provide abortion”—in small, gray print underneath the ad. This policy resulted from [research](https://msmagazine.com/Users/Carrie/Documents/Beth%20Israel%20Deaconess%20Medical%20Center) conducted in 2018 showing that only one-third of Google ads facilitated abortion referrals, while another third hindered abortion referrals. (The rest neither facilitated nor hindered access.)

But even after the adoption of the new policy, abortion rights advocates noticed that the warnings were often missing. So, activists at the abortion pill advocacy organization [Plan C](https://www.plancpills.org/) made it a priority to work with Google to ensure flagging of all abortion-related ads.
