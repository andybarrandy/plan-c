On Monday, _Politico_ published a leaked draft opinion indicating that _Roe v. Wade_, the landmark ruling that guarantees the right to access abortion, may soon be struck down.

In the hours after the news broke, social media was flooded with frenzied messages about stockpiling birth control and [Plan B](https://www.verywellhealth.com/plan-b-one-step-906725). Interest in the search terms “abortion pill” jumped three-fold and “buy plan b” quadrupled, according to Google Trends data.

Twitter users shared links to purchase Plan B online, [urging others](https://twitter.com/SarahSNunya/status/1521574065353289728?s=20&t=oph_Lb4PLIOOIKhy8P-9sQ) to build an emergency supply in case the medication becomes difficult to acquire. In an email to Verywell, a CVS spokesperson said emergency contraception “continues to be available at CVS Pharmacy locations,” but gave no updates on sales.

Plan C, a nonprofit that provides information about getting medically safe abortion pills, saw 56,000 visitors after the news, according to [_The_ _Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/04/abortion-pills-online-telemedicine/). Those seeking an abortion can get the pills online, sometimes from overseas pharmacies that aren’t beholden to U.S. laws. Plan C allows people to order abortion pills, “to keep in their medicine cabinet just in case their period is late.”
