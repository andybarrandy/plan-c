As the [Supreme Court](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/supreme-court) looks poised to overturn the key cases protecting abortion rights, many American women say they’re preparing for the worst.

“We have to prepare for contraceptives to also be targeted,” Arlin Tellez, 23, told [_Bloomberg_](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-03/leaked-supreme-court-abortion-opinion-spurs-some-to-stockpile-plan-b-pill). “At this point, the possibilities are endless, so I’d rather be prepared.”

After the court’s draft majority opinion – declaring [_Roe v Wade_](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/roe-v-wade) and _Planned Parenthood v Casey_ “must be overruled” – leaked to the public, women across social media said they were stocking up on Plan B pills, making appointments to get intrauterine devices, and taking other steps in case their rights are revoked.
