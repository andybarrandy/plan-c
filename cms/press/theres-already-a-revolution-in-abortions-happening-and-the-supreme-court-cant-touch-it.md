  In the anticipatory years before the abortion pill came to the U.S., it wasn’t
  just the prospect of earlier abortions and easier distribution that excited
  health advocates. It was the chance to give patients a sense of autonomy over
  their own bodies—exactly what they will lose when the Supreme Court allows
  states to assume dominion over their reproduction.

  Can’t Touch It

In the year 2000, it looked like a bright new day for abortion rights.

The FDA was set to approve the first medication specifically designed for terminating a pregnancy: The “French abortion pill,” as it was called—the name, a nod to the drug’s origins, also happened to convey a whiff of the laissez-faire—was about to come to America.

Abortion rights groups had been fighting to make the drug available in the U.S. since the 1980s, when it was first developed. More than a dozen countries had approved the pill, and [more than 500,000 patients](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-sep-29-mn-28639-story.html) had taken it in Europe alone.

For patients in the U.S., gaining widespread access to the drug would mark a “[historical moment](https://www.newspapers.com/image/170505188/?terms=mifepristone&match=1)”—one “comparable to the arrival of the birth control pill 40 years ago,” said the then-president of Planned Parenthood. A Seattle doctor who participated in the drug’s clinical trials predicted in January 2000 that women would eventually be able to receive the pill from their family physicians, sidestepping the need to visit an abortion clinic. “It will mainstream abortion into regular medical care,” she told the Chicago Tribune.

Nearly 22 years later, the U.S. abortion rate has [steadily fallen](https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2019/us-abortion-rate-continues-decline-reaching-historic-low-2017), and [more than half](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-science-health-medication-56972af9e9b0fc2fc97e06041f6e96ce) of abortion patients now get medication instead of undergoing in-clinic procedures. But while the pill has made abortion safer, easier, and more private for millions of patients, political opposition has kept it from fulfilling its initial promise. In addition to strict FDA regulations, dozens of states have placed limits on who can administer the medication and how patients can receive it. It never reached the medical mainstream.
