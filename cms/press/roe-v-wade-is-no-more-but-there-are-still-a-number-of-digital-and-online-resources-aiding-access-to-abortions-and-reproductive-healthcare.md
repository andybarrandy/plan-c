Roe v. Wade is no more. Friday’s 6-3 decision in the U.S. Supreme Court ends 50 years of constitutionally-protected protections guaranteeing people with the ability to get pregnant their right to bodily autonomy in reproductive healthcare, all thanks to a highest court now defined by Christian-conservatism over anything.

Despite Cheif Justice Roberts, Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh stating their belief that Roe v. Wade was settled legal precedent during their confirmation hearings, but all either joined or concurred with Justice Alito’s opinion that the decision was “egregiously wrong.”

At least [20 states](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/24/abortion-state-laws-criminalization-roe/) are on track to implement incredibly restrictive or full bans on abortion in the very near-future, with 13 states currently having “trigger bans” in place that enact abortion bans anywhere from 30 days to immediately after Roe v. Wade is struck down.
