Instagram has deleted some posts and limited at least two hashtags related to abortion services, according to some of the platform’s users and warnings that have been added to certain topics.

The platform also briefly suspended and then reinstated an account belonging to an abortion services location platform.

NBC News found that searches for two terms and hashtags related to [abortion pills](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/end-roe-v-wade-access-abortion-pills-rcna34862) — prescribed pills that can be taken to induce abortion and are [still available](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/27/women-in-states-that-ban-abortion-will-still-be-able-to-get-abortion-pills-online-from-overseas.html) for mail order in all 50 states from overseas providers — returned almost no new posts, indicating that the company is limiting what users can see.

Unlike normal searches on Instagram, searches for “abortion pills” and “mifepristone” (a popular abortion pill) on Monday did not immediately yield results. On the hashtags for the same terms, a message was displayed that recent posts with the tags “are hidden because some posts may not follow Instagram’s Community Guidelines.” The note does not specify what guidelines have been violated, and it’s not clear when Instagram began limiting the hashtags.

The limitations placed on the hashtags mean that the most recent posts with the tags, which are usually found in a separate tab, aren’t available for users to see. For anyone searching for up-to-date information on the hashtag pages, that means they will have to scroll through older, more-liked posts first, including anti-abortion posts.
