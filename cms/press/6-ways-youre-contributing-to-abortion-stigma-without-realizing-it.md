A bombshell [Supreme Court draft opinion](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-leaked-draft-arguments_n_6272b1b4e4b00fbab6291298) leaked in May confirmed [long-standing fears](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/scotus-leaked-decision-roe-v-wade-overturn-reactions_n_6270842be4b050c90f4355f5) that the court’s conservative majority could strike down Roe v.
