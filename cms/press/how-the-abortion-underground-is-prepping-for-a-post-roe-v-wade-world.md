f_excerpt: >-
  Back in early December 2021, you may have heard some rumblings celebrating
  that the FDA had changed some of its draconian and scientifically unsupported
  regulations around medication abortion. Medication abortion, a safe and legal
  method of first-trimester abortion, accounted for 54% of US abortions in 2020
  but has been subject to decades of politically-motivated FDA regulations that
  placed strict and unnecessary controls on it to limit access. To explain the
  implications of the update, we are rejoined on the podcast by Elisa Wells,
  Co-Director of Plan C Pills, a website and organization that provides
  information about how to access abortion pills in all 50 US states. Elisa
  explains why this is a win and for whom it's a win for abortion access - but
  also for whom these changes make no difference at all.

Back in early December 2021, you may have heard some rumblings celebrating that the FDA had changed some of its draconian and scientifically unsupported regulations around medication abortion. Medication abortion, a safe and legal method of first-trimester abortion, accounted for 54% of US abortions in 2020 but has been subject to decades of politically-motivated FDA regulations that placed strict and unnecessary controls on it to limit access. In late 2021, amidst the most hostile environment to abortion since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, some of these limits were lifted. However, the news stories reporting on the updates didn't exactly make it clear which problems the changes would solve and which they wouldn't. As the Supreme Court is poised in June 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade, and states are leveling increasingly hostile attacks towards abortion rights in the meantime, any expansion of access is a good thing, and this FDA update is definitely a good thing - but is not a panacea. Â To explain the implications of the update, we are rejoined on the podcast by Elisa Wells, Co-Director of Plan C Pills, a website and organization that provides information about how to access abortion pills in all 50 US states. Elisa explains why this is a win and for whom it's a win for abortion access - but also for whom these changes make no difference at all. As the potential end of Roe nears, it's more important now than ever that we understand - and work to lift - the obstacles to abortion access that millions of Americans of reproductive age face. \[Please note that this episode was recorded on January 14, 2022. Additional states have passed incredibly strict abortion bans since then, including Idaho, Florida, Oklahoma, and Kentucky.\]
