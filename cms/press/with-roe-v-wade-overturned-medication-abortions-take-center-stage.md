With the overturning of Roe v. Wade Friday by the Supreme Court, the power to decide abortion access now depends on individual states.

As of today, nearly half of the nation's 50 states are prepared to ban all or nearly all abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health policy research organization.

The increasing likelihood of abortion restrictions across the country has put the attention on medication abortions, which rely on pills, rather than surgery, to terminate the pregnancy.
