People use mail forwarding (also called a virtual mailbox) as one way to access abortion pills. They use a telemedicine service in another state and a mail forwarding service to get pills mailed to their home. It takes about one week to get the pills this way. The $45-55 it costs is often much less than the gas to drive to another state. It saves on taking off from work or finding babysitting. Since the pills are recommended for up to 11 or 12 weeks from the last period, there is often time. Here is an example of how one person did this.

**‍FIRST**: She checked our [map of states](#map). She found a state that has telehealth abortion services. She chose California because it had many services.

**SECOND**: She set up a "virtual mailbox" in California. She used [PostScan Mail](https://www.postscanmail.com/).

*   She filled out a form with her personal information and home address.
*   The virtual mailbox used this information to fill out a USPS form that gives them permission to handle her mail. She signed the form.
*   The cost for a virtual mailbox was about $35. This included $15 for one month mailbox rental plus a $20 online notary fee for the form.
*   The virtual mailbox company provided the online notary service. She used her webcam for the brief online notary meeting (connecting by phone camera was also possible).
*   She needed to show two forms of ID, one with a photo.
*   She needed a credit card.
*   She needed an email address or phone number.
*   It was easy to set up.
*   It took a few days to get approved. **She waited until she got email confirmation that it was set up before doing the telehealth consultation.**

**THIRD**: She checked our [Guide](/find-pills) to find a telehealth abortion service in California (where she had the virtual mailbox).

*   She chose a telehealth service that did not require a video visit, because it was more convenient. Services that do not require a video visit include: Aid Access, CHOIX, Forward Midwifery, Full Circle Health Center, Hey Jane, Lilith Care, and Pills by Post. \[NOTE: Abortion on Demand does not ship to post office box or virtual addresses.\]
*   She filled in the online consultation form. She had to show her ID.
*   She listed her new virtual mailbox address in California as the _shipping address_ for the abortion pills.
*   She paid the telehealth fee using a credit card. They asked for the _billing address_ for the credit card. She gave them her home billing address.

**FOURTH**: She watched her virtual mailbox account in California so she would know when the package arrived.

*   She asked for it to be forwarded to her home address.
*   She had to choose between USPS, FedEx, and UPS forwarding services.
*   There was a fee for this (about $15-20).
*   It was easy.
*   The forwarding service gave her a tracking number. She checked it so she would know what day her pills would arrive.
*   The pills arrived at her home a few days later.

**FIFTH**: She cancelled the virtual mailbox so that she would not be charged another monthly fee.
