The “abortion pill" or "abortion with pills” is a modern option for ending an early pregnancy safely and effectively. It is also called "medication abortion." It uses two kinds of pills: mifepristone and misoprostol (or misoprostol only, if mifepristone is not available).

##### Method 1: Mifepristone + Misoprostol

This is the most common method of abortion with pills. You take a mifepristone pill first, followed by misoprostol pills 24 to 48 hours later. This is the most effective method of abortion with pills (95-98% of the abortions are successful). It has the fewest side effects. It is [approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information). This is the type of abortion with pills provided by clinics like [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/the-abortion-pill/how-do-i-get-the-abortion-pill) and recommended by the [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.](https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2016/03/acog-statement-on-medication-abortion)

##### Method 2: Misoprostol Only

Abortion with pills can also be done using [only misoprostol pills](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6309472/). This is less effective than when mifepristone and misoprostol are both taken (about 85% of the abortions are successful).  This is endorsed by the [World Health Organization](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70914/1/9789241548434_eng.pdf?ua=1) in places where mifepristone is not available.

*   Both methods are effective and very safe. Both methods are also [widely used by people around the world](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32912726/). We provide information about both methods on this website.
*   Using abortion pills does not require the presence of a doctor. Some people find and [take the medications safely on their own](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00017-5/fulltext). This is called self-managed abortion.
