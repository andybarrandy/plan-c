Abortion pills block pregnancy hormones (mifepristone) and cause cramping and bleeding (misoprostol). This causes the pregnancy to end and come out of the body. It is like a miscarriage. You can expect a few hours of heavy bleeding and cramping and several days of lighter bleeding.  

For more information, watch this video from the International Planned Parenthood Federation about how abortion pills work.
