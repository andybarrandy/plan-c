[Abortion pills work best in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy](https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/about/). Using pills later in pregnancy is more painful and less effective. The risk of complications also goes up as the pregnancy grows.

This [calculator](https://aidaccess.org/en/page/433/how-do-you-know-if-you-are-pregnant-and-how-long-you-have-been-pregnant-for) can help you know how many weeks pregnant you are. It is based on the first day of your last normal period. People who don’t know the first day of their last period or who have periods that don’t come regularly may need to have an ultrasound or pelvic exam to find out how many weeks pregnant they are.
