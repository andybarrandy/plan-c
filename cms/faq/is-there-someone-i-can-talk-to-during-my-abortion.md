Yes. There are many free services that can help support you during your abortion. [The Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline](https://www.mahotline.org/) provides free, confidential medical information and support by phone and text. Other services, like the [Reprocare Healthline](https://abortionhotline.org/), can provide emotional support and practical information about what to expect by phone or text during your home abortion. There are even some chatbots and apps (like Euki and Safe Abortion App)Â that can help guide you.
