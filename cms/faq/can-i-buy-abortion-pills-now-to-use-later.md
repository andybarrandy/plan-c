Yes. Some people who are not pregnant get abortion pills to keep in their medicine cabinet just in case their period is late. They can then take the pills right away without having to wait a long time for shipping. Some services listed in our [Guide to Pills](/find-pills) let you order pills in advance (Aid Access offers this "advance provision" in all states).

If you decide to use pills later, Aid Access will still help you with instructions and follow up support.
