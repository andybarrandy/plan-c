Most people use a pregnancy test to confirm that they are pregnant. Most people do no[t need any other medical tests to get abortion pills](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33605016/). The clinic or telehealth service may ask you to get additional tests if:

*   You are unsure of when you had your last period
*   You have any history or symptoms of ectopic pregnancy (like pelvic pain)
