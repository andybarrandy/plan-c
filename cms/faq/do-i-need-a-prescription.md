**_Yes, and no._** Abortion pills are prescription medications in the US. But, it is also possible to get them from some places without a prescription.

People can get a prescription for the pills from abortion clinics, telemedicine services, and some medical offices. Click on "find pills" to learn how to get pills in your state.

We also know that many people are buying abortion pills from online pharmacies without a prescription. Some people also find the pills in bodegas or across the border in Mexico. Finding and using pills without consulting a medical provider is often called "self-managed" abortion. [Our Guide](/find-pills) to finding pills provides information about how people are doing this. It is important for those considering this option to understand any legal risks (see below--[Can IÂ Get in Trouble?](/faq#can-i-get-in-trouble-for-using-abortion-pills)).
