Using abortion pills is very [safe](https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/medication-abortion-safety.pdf). Abortion pills are safest and most effective for pregnancies of less than [13 weeks](https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/about/). This means less than 91 days counting from the first day of the last regular period. The World Health Organization provides [guidelines for safely self-managing abortion](https://srhr.org/abortioncare/chapter-3/service-delivery-options-and-self-management-approaches-3-6/self-management-recommendation-50-self-management-of-medical-abortion-in-whole-or-in-part-at-gestational-ages-12-weeks-3-6-2/) up to 12 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period.

The rate of major complications during an early abortion is very low. Having an abortion is safer than continuing a pregnancy and having a baby.

One risk is that abortion pills may not work (they may not end the pregnancy). The pills are less effective when taken later in pregnancy. You can take a pregnancy test 3-4 weeks after taking the pills to make sure they worked:

*   If the test is positive, it is important to get follow-up care.
*   A pregnancy test done earlier than 3-4 weeks after an abortion may show a false positive. This is because it takes time for the pregnancy hormones to leave the body.
*   Most people can tell they are no longer pregnant soon after the abortion because their symptoms of pregnancy go away.

Another risk is if the pregnancy is outside the womb. This is called an ectopic or tubal pregnancy. This is very rare (only about 2 of every 100 pregnancies). Because ectopic pregnancy can lead to serious health consequences, it is important to:

*   Always do a pregnancy test 3-4 weeks after taking the pills
*   Immediately seek follow up care at any medical facility if the test is positive
*   Seek care if you have any continued signs or symptoms of pregnancy after the abortion. Common signs of ectopic pregnancy are severe and increasing abdominal pain, particularly if it is one sided.
