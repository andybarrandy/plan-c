Many online pharmacies sell abortion pills. They do not do a medical consultation. They do not require a prescription. They ship to addresses in all US states.

Are these services real? Yes, many are. But, they are not regulated by the US government. They sell generic abortion pills that have not been inspected by the US government.

Plan C regularly tests these online pharmacies by buying pills from them. The services we list in our [Guide](/find-pills) all shipped pills to us at our home addresses. The pills were real (based on laboratory testing). But, we do not operate these sites and cannot guarantee they will be reliable in the future.

**Here is how online pharmacies work:**

*   The buyer selects the desired product (often called an MTP Kit, for “medical termination of pregnancy”). Our test buyers looked to make sure there was one pill of mifepristone and four pills of misoprostol. Some pharmacies sold only three misoprostol pills, which is not [the medical standard](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/mifeprex-mifepristone-information). \[NOTE: People who are more than 9 weeks pregnant sometimes also buy 4-8 extra misoprostol pills to have on hand in case they need them to complete the abortion.\]
*   The buyer fills out their address and payment information.
*   The buyer choses the type of shipping they want. In our tests, “express” shipping was usually mailed from the United States and arrived in 4-6 days. “Regular” shipping was mailed from abroad and took several weeks.
*   **IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PAYMENT:** It is very common for these online pharmacy services to email or call soon after they get the order and request a different form of payment. They often say the credit card did not go through. They often ask the buyer to use a PayPal account in a person’s name or in the name of another business. These payment requests do seem unusual, but they worked every time we tested them.
*   The pills usually arrive by US Postal Service. They usually do not require a signature.
