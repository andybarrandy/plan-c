There are two main ways to access abortion pills in the United States:

*   Clinician-supported, means you get the pills after a consultation with a doctor or nurse practitioner. This can be in a clinic or through a telehealth service. Telehealth services mail you the pills after a medical consultation. You then use them at home.

*   Self-managed, means you find the pills without consulting a medical professional. You then use them at home.

Examples of clinician-supported services include: 

*   [Abortion on Demand](https://AbortionOnDemand.org)
*   [carafem](https://carafem.org)
*   [CHOIX](https://www.mychoix.co)
*   [Just the Pill](https://www.justthepill.com)
*   [Hey Jane](https://heyjane.co)
*   [Forward Midwifery](https://provider.kareo.com/forward-midwifery)
*   [Full Circle Healthcare](https://fullcirclehealthcenter.com/)
*   [Metro Area Advance Practice Clinicians](https://metroarea.health/abortion)
*   [Pills by Post](https://www.pillsbypost.com)
*   [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org)
*   Your family doctor
*   [Aid Access](https://aidaccess.org)

Examples of self-managed abortion include: 

*   Buying and taking pills from an online pharmacy
*   Finding pills in a bodega
*   Purchasing pills from a pharmacy in another country, without a prescription

Both ways to access pills are safe, but self-managed abortion may have some legal risks. See our section ["Can I get in trouble for using abortion pills?"](/faq#can-i-get-in-trouble-for-using-abortion-pills) for more information about the legal considerations for self-managed abortion.
