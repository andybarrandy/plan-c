No. Plan B is emergency contraception. You can take it up to 5 days after having sex without using birth control. Plan B prevents pregnancy.

Plan C is our term for abortion pills. These are taken after a missed period (up to 77 days from the first day of your last normal period).

We believe that everyone should have access to all options:Â 

*   **Plan A** is birth control to prevent pregnancy.
*   **Plan B** is emergency contraception (also to prevent pregnancy)
*   **Plan C** is abortion pills.
