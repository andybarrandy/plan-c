Misinformation on the internet is common. Misinformation is false, inaccurate, or misleading guidance shared with the purpose of confusing someone.

To avoid false information and abortion scams, beware of these two common tactics used to trick people looking for abortion information.

##### **Abortion pill “reversal”**

Abortion reversal claims are false -- you can not “reverse” an abortion. People who share this information claim that taking progesterone after taking the first abortion pill can make the pregnancy continue. There is no scientific evidence that progesterone will reverse the abortion process.

If you’d like to learn more, we recommend [this resource](https://www.acog.org/advocacy/facts-are-important/medication-abortion-reversal-is-not-supported-by-science) created by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  

##### **Fake abortion clinics**

Fake abortion clinics are another method of tricking people looking for abortion information. Fake clinics are usually called "pregnancy centers" or "crisis pregnancy centers." They often use the same language and information-sharing techniques as real abortion clinics and resources. These sites trick people into thinking they are making an appointment for an abortion. This is harmful because it delays access to care.

The online [Clinic Checker](https://legit.clinic) will help you check if a clinic is legitimate.
