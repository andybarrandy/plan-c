The website [howtouseabortionpill.org](https://www.howtouseabortionpill.org/) has great information about what to expect when you take the pills and how to manage side effects. This fact sheet in [English](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62dc819617f7b01d65d53943/t/62dc88adce84dc1512eb0e06/1658620080498/How+To+Use+Abortion+Pills.pdf) and [Spanish](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/62dc819617f7b01d65d53943/t/62dc89e9a6c55f515ada4193/1658620398785/COMO+USAR+LAS+PASTILLAS+ABORTIVAS.pdf) provides a good summary of what to expect and when to seek additional care.

**Common symptoms:**

Abortion pills cause bleeding and cramping. This is part of the abortion process and shows that the pills are working. Many people do not have any symptoms after taking the first pill (mifepristone). The bleeding and cramping usually start soon after taking the second set of pills (misoprostol).

The bleeding may be heavier than a normal period. The cramping can be mild to severe. This can vary for each person. It also depends on how far along the pregnancy is.

Other common side effects are feeling sick to your stomach, throwing up, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and fevers.

##### **Severe symptoms that require immediate medical attention:**

*   bleeding that soaks through more than 2 maxi sanitary pads per hour for more than 2 hours in a row, OR
*   fever of more than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 24 hours, OR
*   fever of more than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit for any length of time

The [Miscarriage and Abortion Hotline](https://www.mahotline.org/) is a free service staffed by licensed clinicians. They can help answer medical questions about miscarriage and abortion.
