Planned Parenthood states that it is an experienced and trusted abortion provider.  We also provide online telemedicine appointments for medication abortion for patients who have early pregnancies and no medical contraindications.  Medications and supplies are conveniently shipped to your home.  Our fees include all follow up services to ensure you are doing well after your abortion, including follow up done by telemedicine or if necessary in one of our health centers.

For pregnancies of over 8 weeks from last menstrual period, we may ask you to get an ultrasound.
