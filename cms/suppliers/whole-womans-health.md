  Whole Woman’s Health states that it is a privately-owned, feminist healthcare
  service committed to providing holistic care for all. We provide comprehensive
  gynecology services, including abortion care both in-person and via virtual
  telehealth appointments. It is our philosophy that everyone must be at the
  center of their own healthcare decisions, and that treating people
  holistically — honoring head, heart, and body — will better serve and improve
  health and happiness of our communities.
