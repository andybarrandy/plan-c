Choix states that it is a telemedicine clinic offering abortion care as part of a variety of sexual and reproductive healthcare services. Choix offers abortion care via an online platform to patients who are less than 11 weeks pregnant, and offers advance provision of abortion pills for people who wish to keep pills on hand for future use. Choix's experienced clinicians provide compassionate, accessible and safe care to patients and abortion medications are shipped by mail. No appointments are necessary and in most cases, patients are not required to get an ultrasound to receive care.
