  Juniper Midwifery states that it is a telemedicine medication abortion
  practice founded by two midwives in an effort to expand access to safe,
  affordable, and convenient abortion care. We honor informed choice, seek to
  empower patients, and aim to destigmatize abortion by extending the midwifery
  model of care to the full spectrum of reproductive health.
