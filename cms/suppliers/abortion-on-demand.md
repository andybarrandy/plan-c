Abortion on Demand states that it provides virtual visits to adult patients who are up to 9 weeks pregnant on the day that they schedule their appointment.We donate our excess funds to support independent abortion clinics providing later or more complex care. Same day scheduling is often available; overnight shipping and comfort medications are included. Discreet text-based follow-up and 24/7 clinician phone support if needed. Our software will confirm you are physically in the state you selected at the time of your scheduled video appointment. We do not ship to post office box addresses. In Pennsylvania, patients must pick up their medications at designated locations in Maryland orNew Jersey. In Washington DC, patients must pick up their medications at designated locations in Maryland.
