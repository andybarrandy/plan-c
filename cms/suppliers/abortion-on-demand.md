  Abortion on Demand states that it provides virtual visits to adult patients
  who are up to 9 weeks pregnant on the day that they schedule their
  appointment.We donate our excess funds to support independent abortion clinics
  providing later or more complex care. Same day scheduling is often available;
  overnight shipping and comfort medications are included. Discreet text-based
  follow-up and 24/7 clinician phone support if needed. Our software will
  confirm you are physically in the state you selected at the time of your
  scheduled video appointment. We do not ship to post office box addresses. In
  Pennsylvania, patients must pick up their medications at designated locations
  in Maryland orNew Jersey. In Washington DC, patients must pick up their
  medications at designated locations in Maryland.
