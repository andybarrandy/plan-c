  HealthQ states that it proudly offers medication abortion via a telehealth
  appointment with the option for you to get your pills by “mail” (our suppliers
  use FedEx) or picking them up in one of our health centers (in Beverly,
  Haverhill or Lawrence).


  Our highly trained staff is available to guide you through the process and in
  the rare event someone needs follow-up care in-clinic, we can help you in
  person at any of our three locations.


  MassHealth covers the full cost of telehealth abortion at HealthQ and we
  accept most major insurances. Our team is here to help you navigate insurance
  coverage and we have excellent relationships with financial assistance
  organizations if needed.


  To schedule an appointment call 978-927-9824. Please also check out our
  website healthq.org to see our wide range of telehealth and in person services
  including birth control, STI testing and treatment, gender affirming care,
  PrEP, and more.


  Hablamos Español.
