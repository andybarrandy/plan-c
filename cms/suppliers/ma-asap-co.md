  MA-ASAP states that it is a research study underway at Planned Parenthood of
  the Rocky Mountains. The study is evaluating a streamlined way for people to
  get medication abortion pills by filling out a form on the internet, without
  an in-person or video visit with the abortion provider. We expect that this
  approach may be especially convenient for people who have difficulty
  scheduling an appointment with a clinic. Find out more on our website,
  www.ma-asap.org.
