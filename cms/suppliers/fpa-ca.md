Since 1969, FPA Women's Health states that it has been providing the highest standard of abortion care in a warm, caring environment.  FPA's Telehealth program is supported directly by their 25 clinics across California.  Patients eligible for virtual care can be seen exclusively through Telehealth, while any in-person needs (like an ultrasound or birth control) can be met with same-day access in the clinics.  Most insurances are accepted and on-site enrollment into certain Medi-Cal programs is available for patients who need financial assistance.
