  Blue Mountain Clinic states that it has been a part of the Missoula community
  for over 40 years! We are a full family practice health care clinic, and also
  offer Mental Health Therapy. Blue Mountain Clinic provides patient-centered,
  family practice and primary care services to the local community through a
  choice-based perspective. We believe that choices in any health care decision
  should be met with dignity in a supportive environment. Blue Mountain Clinic
  strives to provide feminist-based approaches to health care, education, and
  advocacy in the region. Essential activities to fulfill this mission require
  visible advocacy on the local level to improve policies that have a negative
  impact on patientsâ€™ economic and political access to health care.
