Aid Access states that it is a clinician-supported fully online telemedicine service with mailed pills for patients who have early pregnancies and no medical contraindications. In this state, the medications are prescribed by clinicians licensed in the US and are FDA-approved products. In this state, USÂ clinicians are only able to serve patients who are 16 and older. The international arm of Aid Access (also listed here) still serves younger patients.

*   Quick, affordable, convenient access to safe and effective abortion pills through telehealth consultation.
*   Offers email support.
*   Offers sliding fee scale, but does not usually accept insurance or Medicaid.
*   Pricing does not include cost of follow up in-clinic treatment in the rare event it is needed.
