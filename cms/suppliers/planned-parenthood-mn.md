  Planned Parenthood North Central States states that it believes everyone
  deserves access to care – no matter who you are or where you live. Our
  telehealth services make abortion care more accessible with the same level of
  care, comfort, and safety as a traditional medication abortion (also known as
  "the abortion pill"). After you complete your online visit via text or video,
  the medication will be shipped to the mailing address you provide. Financial
  Counselors and Abortion Navigators are available to help patients find
  assistance with scheduling, preparing for, and paying for abortion care.
