  Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts states that it is proud to offer
  medication abortion care via telehealth to patients across Massachusetts in an
  effort to increase access and remove barriers to much needed health care.
  Price range dependent on need for birth control prescription, follow-up care,
  and potential for in-clinic services in the event of ineligibility for
  Mife-by-Mail, if patient chooses.


  If you’re interested in telemedicine abortion care, please give us a call at
  1-800-258-4448 to schedule an appointment. There is no online appointment
  scheduling for this service at this time. Please expect the visit to take
  approximately 90 minutes. Pills can only be mailed to Massachusetts addresses.
