Planned Parenthood states that their staff are experts in providing abortion care. Our medication abortion team includes a physician licensed in the state of Pennsylvania, a patient navigator to help you through the process, and a licensed 24 hour on call clinician in case you need support after hours. The medications we provide are FDA approved and meet strict regulations for safety and effectiveness. The entire process from the first phone call to receiving your medications can take one to two weeks, so be sure to call as soon as possible.

NOTE:Â You must submit the results of a urine test and blood work to use this service.
