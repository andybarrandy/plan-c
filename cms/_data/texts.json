Self-managed abortions are harder to track in numbers, by nature of being self-managed: but people report choosing this option for many reasons, including cost, lack of access to clinic-based care - 90% of US counties don’t currently have an abortion clinic or provider - and the desire for increased convenience and control. Research studies show that people can accurately evaluate their eligibility for abortion pill use and complete the method successfully, without the need for an ultrasound or in-person consult. ",
  "321c86cf": "But for reasons founded in politics not medicine, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  restricts access to mifepristone, putting the U.S. radically out-of-step with international guidelines and preventing access for those who would need this method most of all. These restrictions could be changed by the FDA alone without needing any action from Congress. ",

The solid evidence published by our research partners during this period of tremendous healthcare innovation has helped validate this transformative new opportunity for more self-managed care and helped reassure providers, politicians, and the public about its safely, feasibility and acceptability.

  "-502db9b1": "This creative guide and video series began as a collaborative, community-centered response to the introduction of SB-8 in Texas in September 2021. From October through December 2021, requests for abortion pills from Texans nearly tripled—and we realized we didn’t know much about how they worked or the legal risks.",
  "195c45ea": "In collaboration with 20+ Texas-based creatives, filmmaker Lindsey L33 and Plan C, we went on a journey from Fall 2021 through Summer 2022 to research abortion pill options in the US and turn that into art. During that time, Roe v. Wade was overturned and Texas’ current trigger ban on abortion went into effect, endangering Texans’ lives, as well as introducing criminalization and additional legal risks for those seeking abortions. ",
  "-10b833ec": "Still, we know our communities are continuing to seek access to abortion pills through direct mail from other states or in neighboring countries like Mexico. We’re also all determining what the future around supporting reproductive rights organizations and taking care of ourselves looks like. And, thankfully, we still have our voices.",
  "-3c057e5e": "So, beyond a creative guide to abortion pills, this is a call to action. Our hope is to inspire the creative communities we work and live in to speak openly and candidly about abortion access in Texas through art, education and activism, too.",
