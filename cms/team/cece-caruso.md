Caitlyn Caruso (they/she), also known as Cece, has over 8 years of experience in the sexual health field, predominantly in community organizing, engagement, and communications. They approach all of their work from a reproductive justice framework and are humbled to have worked across the field in several capacities over the years. They attended University of Nevada Las Vegas, and received a Bachelors degree in Critical Race, Gender, & Ethnic Studies with a concentration in communications before moving across the country to Washington DC. It was there that they joined Advocates for Youth as their state and local campaigns manager, working specifically with young people and students across the nation. She now works both at ETR as a marketing assistant, and at Plan C Pills, serving as their digital organizer. When Cece’s not working, she’s spending time with her two cats and partner, doing mutual aid work, and doodling/painting the hours away.
