Elisa Wells is a public health specialist with 30 years of experience in the reproductive health movement, both in the United States and abroad.She specializes in emerging technologies and innovative approaches to reproductive health care, including emergency contraception and medication abortion. She spent her early career at PATH, and has since consulted for a wide variety of organizations, including the MacArthur Foundation, Planned Parenthood, Reproductive Health Technologies Project, the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, and more.

In 2015, she co-founded Plan C, a groundbreaking campaign that shines a light on the overmedicalization and overregulation of abortion pills and advocates for a safe, effective self-managed option in the US to counter the politics and stigma that have crippled access. Since then, Plan C has grown to become a leader in the movement for reproductive rights and abortion access and Elisa has become a voice in press and media, willing to challenge the status quo and put forth a vision for a new reality: a world with democratized access to these safe, effective pills as a self-managed care option.Â 

From her first job as an abortion counselor in Boston to her years of work abroad in countries with far fewer resources and rights, Elisa brings practical solutions, passion, and action to the fight to improve abortion access in the United States.
