She is cofounder & digital director for Plan C, a leading information campaign for safe self-managed abortion with a guide to abortion pills by mail from all 50 states ([plancpills.org](https://plancpills.org/)).

Her design studio Eyes Open leads web design and strategy consulting for a range of purpose-driven individuals and organizations ([eyesopendesign.com](https://eyesopendesign.com/)). Before this she cofounded social enterprise Journey, which led 600+ people on international trips to experience transformative impact projects with the communities served ([wejourney.co](https://wejourney.co/)). She also worked on major anti-sex trafficking initiatives in NYC and SE Asia as the issue came into public awareness in the 2010's, which led her deeper into the issues of reproductive health and self-determination she explores today.
