Medically speaking, taking abortion pills after a telehealth consultation is as safe and effective as going to a clinic in person. And, it is also medically safe to take pills from an online pharmacy, even without consulting a doctor, as long as you have good information and access to follow-up care if you need it.   

But, in states where politicians have unjustly banned access to telehealth abortion, it could be legally risky. Some people have been criminalized for self-managing their abortions.

Since 2000, at least 60 people who have self-managed an abortion are known to have been prosecuted.

No one should be criminalized for managing their own health care. But, we know that it has happened and we know that some people will be disproportionately affected, including people of color, those with financial insecurity, and LGTBQ+ folks. For more information about how to access abortion pills–even in states with restrictions, and for links to free and confidential medical and legal hotline support, visit the [Guide to Pills.](/guide) 

We at Plan C see the injustice of differential access for this basic health care option. Your access to basic medical care should not be determined by your zip code.
