Research has shown that for the vast majority of patients they are just as medically safe to use at home as in the clinic. In fact, most often the process at a clinic is to send the person home to take the pills. Most people don’t need to take any tests first, but a clinic or telehealth service may ask a person to get additional tests if they are unsure of when they had their last period, and/or they have any  history or symptoms of ectopic pregnancy (like pelvic pain).
