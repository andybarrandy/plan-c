As our country faces unprecedented barriers to access, with politicians continuing to pass unjust laws and threats to Roe, abortion pills will continue to be available and Plan C wil continue to share information and research on how we know people are accessing this option. 

In fact, we believe that if SCOTUS upends Roe, abortion pills by mail will be a central way to how people will continue to access safe abortion despite unjust laws in their state. 

In conservative states there is understandable concern about criminalization – and even though there should be no reason for state laws to create barriers to healthcare and body autonomy, this is what is already happening – and we know the risk is outsized for marginalized communities. 

We’ll continue to share medical and legal context so an individual visiting our guide can assess their own risk and make the decision that’s best for their body and their situation. 

Others are working on “breakthrough strategies” like advance provision, conscientious provision, and other intersectional human rights approaches to overcome these unjust barriers and support access for all, no matter what a person’s zip code.
