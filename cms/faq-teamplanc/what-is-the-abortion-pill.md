The “abortion pill” is actually 5 pills. It’s a combination of two medications: Mifepristone and Misoprostol, taken 1-2 days apart.  These medications stop a pregnancy from growing by blocking the pregnancy hormones then causing cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus, which is similar to having a miscarriage.  This method is also called a "medication abortion."
