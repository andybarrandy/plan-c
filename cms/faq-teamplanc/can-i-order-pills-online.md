Abortion pills can be ordered online from all 50 states. About half of the country is served by telehealth abortion services like heyjane.co and abortionondemand.org. In states with restrictions, patients can order pills through aidaccess.org, which operates outside the U.S., but they should know this may be legally risky (see below). Most suppliers offer advance provision of pills â€“ to have on hand in the medicine cabinet if necessary.
