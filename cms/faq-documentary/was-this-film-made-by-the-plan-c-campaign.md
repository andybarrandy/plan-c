No. This documentary was funded, shot and produced over four years (2018 - 2022) by independent documentary filmmaker [Tracy Droz Tragos](https://www.tracydroztragos.com/). This story is the filmmaker's capturing and retelling of a pivotal moment in recent history, when the pandemic led to changes in FDA restrictions and new possibilities in pill access. It follows activists and providers as they worked to improve direct access and aid people in need, in the face of crumbling reproductive rights & access in the US.
