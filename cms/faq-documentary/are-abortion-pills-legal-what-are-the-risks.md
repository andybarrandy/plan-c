Self-managing an abortion is not a criminal act, and restricting abortion access is considered by leading justice organizations to be a human rights violation. No one should be punished for seeking healthcare, and as researchers at Plan CÂ we know that people will continue to search for and use pills in states with abortion bans and no in-clinic options.

However, some people who have used abortion pills on their own have gotten in [legal trouble](https://www.ifwhenhow.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20_04_Final_SMA_TheLaw_COVID-19_FactSheet_PDF.pdf) in the United States. The ReproLegalHelpline exists to offer free support to anyone with questions on their situation. Read more on [Plan C's main FAQ's here](http://plancpills.org/faq).
