**There are close to 3,000 fake women's health centers across the country (vs. only around 800 actual abortion providers).**

Sometimes called pregnancy resource centers or crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs), fake clinics do NOT provide comprehensive reproductive health care—instead, they use phony ads to trick pregnant people into making an appointment, promising “free ultrasounds” or “pregnancy support.” Once inside, people are lied to, shamed, and pressured about their reproductive health decisions, often delaying their procedure unnecessarily. More and more, these predatory places are funded by taxpayer dollars, and impact poor women and people of color the hardest.

**You can help, right now, by taking action and correcting misinformation on review sites and spreading the word.**
