**We partnered with Black Women for Wellness on their Get Smart B4 You Get Sexy Campaign.**

This campaign focused on educating and empowering BWW's audience to take medication abortion into their own hands using social media and live virtual events. A central element to this campaign was a virtual storytelling event that engaged the community in a creative conversation about barriers to reproductive access and the importance of reproductive justice.
