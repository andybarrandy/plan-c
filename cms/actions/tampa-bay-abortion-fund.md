**We partnered with Tampa Bay Abortion Fund** to spread the word about safe and effective medication abortion across Tampa Bay. This campaign featured a mobile billboard caravan that lit up streets all throughout the Tampa Bay area with information on how to access medically safe abortion pills by mail.

This project also utilized social media toolkits, volunteer engagement, and local news to energize and engage the Tampa Bay community in the movement for greater access to mailed abortion pills.
