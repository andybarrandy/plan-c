Yes! Go to [plancpills.org/stickers](/stickers) to request free stickers and mini-flyers in both English and Spanish.

Alternatively, you can print your own materials at home or at your local print shop by downloading printable templates for flyers, yard signs and stickers at [plancpills.org/diy-stickers-flyers.](https://plancpills.org/diy-stickers-flyers)
