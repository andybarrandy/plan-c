The Ambassadors of Information (AI) Program includes the opportunity to participate in any number of these two Committees. To gain access to these committees, you will need to [submit an application](https://forms.gle/QLMFU1WBvvdPASwy8). Â Here is more information about each Committee.

###### **COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE**

The Communications Committee will coordinate all things communications-related -- be it coordinating with media, publishing articles/blogs, authoring toolkits, fine-tuning messaging, and more. If you have a way with words, this space might just be for you!

###### **COMMUNITY ORGANIZING COMMITTEE**

The Community Organizing Committee will manage all things -- you guessed it -- community organizing-related. This will range from direct actions, digital campaigns, trainings, calls to action, and policy-related projects and toolkits.
